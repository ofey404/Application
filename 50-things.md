50 things about me in 3 phrases
===============================

## 1 My ID is Me.

I use the same ID `ofey404` in everywhere I want others to find me.

`ofey` is in remind of Richard Feynman, though I'm not working on physics any more, his ideas still influence me a lot.

`404` reminds me the event that makes me fascinated with computer programming.


## 2 First Thing Gives Me Confidence

I broke through China's internet censorship(The great firewall), when I was a freshman.

Unlike others, nobody had ever guided me about that, I made it with heavily polluted information.

It's the first notable thing I do with my personal computer, `404` is in remind of that.


## 3 Easily Available Tools Better

I once heavily customized the user interface of my personal computer. But now I perfer common applications, and a little tweak (vim mode) to make the interface coherent.

I use plain text to store my thoughts, and avoid proprietary file formats, like .doc or most iOS apps.

I guess I visit 200 webpage per day in average.


## 4 My view to Modern Digital World: An Panopticon

I always use cash if possible, instead of online payment methods.

I use cash everyday.


## 5 People I respect, a incomplete list

- Edward Snowden: Yes, that famous guy.
- Richard Feynman: An witty physicist, also famous in Pop culture.
- Richard M Stallman: Harsh godfather of free software.
- Linus Torvalds: Another milder godfather.


## 6 I like Manga

Especially those about giant robots.

I like old school Gekiga(劇画) styles.


## 7 How I Read News

I get through Hacker News every day. Sometimes I'll check Github Trending.

I don't have the habit of reading newsfeed, but twitter informs me some breaking news.

I subscribe some traditional media, like the New Yorker and some local Newspaper. (The sad truth: I seldom read them...)


## 8 Failure Caused by Myself in CPhO

I engaged in China Physics Olympiad in high school. I was quite confident then, my teacher and classmates also thought I was promising.

In CPhO 2016 my solution is graded incorrectly, so I was disappointed and almost gave up the experiment section.

Several days after I submit the application to regrade my solution, it turned out that my grade was very good, but it was too late. I really regret about it.


## 9 First Internship

I get my first internship in PingCAP, an open source database company.

I engaged in their community course Talent Plan, and send my CV along with my solution. Then I got a chance to interview.

Though I'm not quite familiar with their technology stack - golang, I learn it for two weeks and complete their task in interview ahead of time.


## 10 Feynman 1

I like Richard Feynman at high school, I read James Gleick's book about his life, and his three red books - Lecture on Physics.

He inspires me to choose physics as my college major(though my achievement is not quite satifactory). I also imitate his ideas about life in my teenage years.

Nowadays I understand that, to some extent, popular culture cause too much halo effect on his image, but I still regard him as one of my spiritual sensei.


## 11 The Invisible City & Feynman 2

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
> 
> - one of my favourite saying from Feynman.

'Can create' emphasize the understanding of first principle. It doesn't mean to build everything from ground up, but the confidence to do so if necessary.

The scale of the whole modern computer system is beyond anybody's ability to understand. Like a invisible city, you just unable to visit every room in your short life.

But you can take the first principle with you. With a map, knowledge of road signs, you can go anywhere. Maybe Mr. Feynman would become a computer scientist if he borns in 21st century.


## 12 Music 1

I like rock music.

When I was in high school, I perfer thresh metal and hard rock - some aggressive music. After entering college, my interest changed to some early metal band and glam rock.

This year I started trying jazz, funk and some classical music.


## 13 Music 2

I play guitar and bass, but I don't have the skill to perform on the stage.

I start learning guitar in junior high school, but I didn't practise very often now.


## 14 Music 3

As a high school kid, I want to form a band in college.

I get a good electrical guitar from one of my friend and spent my whole summer holiday practising, but I was distracted after my college life start.

I didn't quite get into the lifestyle of a musician, not to mention that I developed a new hobby - programming, which took up too much time.


## 15

I have outstanding skill on whistling. I can play lots of songs with my whistle in tune.


## 16

I get along well with all roommates I have ever met.


## 17 I Tried So Many Labs

During my college life, I've been member of three labs of three different departments.

- SOC lab, Department of Microelectronics.
- Computational Physics lab, Department of Physics
- Now I'm in a lab of Department of Computer Science.

## 18 My First Lab

SOC lab, Department of Microelectronics, is the first lab I enter, when I was a freshman.

I become a TA of the lab, and make our experiment textbook along with another TA, in 2017.


## 19 

The first year of my college life is quite busy. I was working for two labs and preparing a tornament of physics, while having 30 course credits and a girlfriend.

Once I slept on the grass in front of the SOC lab after I came out.


## 20

My first linux distribution is ubuntu 17.04. I know it from the website of FDU's physics experiment center, a senior student posted how to install it there.

It's not a stable version, and I suffers from the great firewall when I try to refresh the software repository.

I encountered many difficulties then, but I really enjoy myself while playing with it.
