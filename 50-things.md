50 things about me in 3 phrases
===============================

## 1 My ID is Me.

I use the same ID `ofey404` in everywhere I want others to find me.

`ofey` is in remind of Richard Feynman, though I'm not working on physics any more, his ideas still influence me a lot.

`404` reminds me the event that makes me fascinated with computer programming.


## 2 First Thing Gives Me Confidence

I broke through China's internet censorship(The great firewall), when I was a freshman.

Unlike others, nobody had ever guided me about that, I made it with heavily polluted information.

It's the first notable thing I do with my personal computer, `404` is in remind of that.


## 3 Easily Available Tools Better

I once heavily customized the user interface of my personal computer. But now I perfer common applications, and a little tweak (vim mode) to make the interface coherent.

I use plain text to store my thoughts, and avoid proprietary file formats, like .doc or most iOS apps.

I guess I visit 200 webpage per day in average.


## 4 My view to Modern Digital World: An Panopticon

I always use cash if possible, instead of online payment methods.

I use cash everyday.


## 5 People I respect, a incomplete list

- Edward Snowden: Yes, that famous guy.
- Richard Feynman: An witty physicist, also famous in Pop culture.
- Richard M Stallman: Harsh godfather of free software.
- Linus Torvalds: Another milder godfather.


## 6 I like Manga

Especially those about giant robots.

I like old school Gekiga(劇画) styles.


## 7 How I Read News

I get through Hacker News every day. Sometimes I'll check Github Trending.

I don't have the habit of reading newsfeed, but twitter informs me some breaking news.

I subscribe some traditional media, like the New Yorker and some local Newspaper. (The sad truth: I seldom read them...)


## 8 Failure Caused by Myself in CPhO

I engaged in China Physics Olympiad in high school. I was quite confident then, my teacher and classmates also thought I was promising.

In CPhO 2016 my solution is graded incorrectly, so I was disappointed and almost gave up the experiment section.

Several days after I submit the application to regrade my solution, it turned out that my grade was very good, but it was too late. I really regret about it.


## 9 First Internship

I get my first internship in PingCAP, an open source database company.

I engaged in their community course Talent Plan, and send my CV along with my solution. Then I got a chance to interview.

Though I'm not quite familiar with their technology stack - golang, I learn it for two weeks and complete their task in interview ahead of time.


## 10 Feynman 1

I like Richard Feynman at high school, I read James Gleick's book about his life, and his three red books - Lecture on Physics.

He inspires me to choose physics as my college major(though my achievement is not quite satifactory). I also imitate his ideas about life in my teenage years.

Nowadays I understand that, to some extent, popular culture cause too much halo effect on his image, but I still regard him as one of my spiritual sensei.


## 11 The Invisible City & Feynman 2

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
> 
> - one of my favourite saying from Feynman.

'Can create' emphasize the understanding of first principle. It doesn't mean to build everything from ground up, but the confidence to do so if necessary.

The scale of the whole modern computer system is beyond anybody's ability to understand. Like a invisible city, you just unable to visit every room in your short life.

But you can take the first principle with you. With a map, knowledge of road signs, you can go anywhere. Maybe Mr. Feynman would become a computer scientist if he borns in 21st century.


## 12 Music 1

I like rock music.

When I was in high school, I perfer thresh metal and hard rock - some aggressive music. After entering college, my interest changed to some early metal band and glam rock.

This year I started trying jazz, funk and some classical music.


## 13 Music 2

I play guitar and bass, but I don't have the skill to perform on the stage.

I start learning guitar in junior high school, but I didn't practise very often now.


## 14 Music 3

As a high school kid, I want to form a band in college.

I get a good electrical guitar from one of my friend and spent my whole summer holiday practising, but I was distracted after my college life start.

I didn't quite get into the lifestyle of a musician, not to mention that I developed a new hobby - programming, which took up too much time.


## 15

I have outstanding skill on whistling. I can play lots of songs with my whistle in tune.


## 16

I get along well with all roommates I have ever met.


## 17 I Tried So Many Labs

During my college life, I've been member of three labs of three different departments.

- SOC lab, Department of Microelectronics.
- Computational Physics lab, Department of Physics
- Now I'm in a lab of Department of Computer Science.

## 18 My First Lab

SOC lab, Department of Microelectronics, is the first lab I enter, when I was a freshman.

I become a TA of the lab, and make our experiment textbook along with another TA, in 2017.


## 19 

The first year of my college life is quite busy. I was working for two labs and preparing a tornament of physics, while having 30 course credits and a girlfriend.

Once I slept on the grass in front of the SOC lab after I came out.


## 20

My first linux distribution is ubuntu 17.04. I know it from the website of FDU's physics experiment center, a senior student posted how to install it there.

It's not a stable version, and I suffers from the great firewall when I try to refresh the software repository.

I encountered many difficulties then, but I really enjoy myself while playing with it.

## Updated after Sept. 14th


## 21

I'm sad I read less book in college than I did in high school.

I worried that my screen time (on cell phone) is too long. I try to spend them in "meaningful" pages, like Hacker News or tech posts noticed on twitter.


## 22

Sometimes I feel pity on spending money, even on necessary usage.

It may be my grandmother's influence.

But now I am learning to take it easy, especially in spending money on long-term benificial things, like learning a skill...

## 23

I think I have some difficulty on executing long-term plan.

Maybe I have a tendency of being too anxious about the undone works, which leads to procrastination.

I don't have a regular bedtime, which would lead to unmeet schedule and anxiety.


## 24

Maybe I'm a bit addicted to manga, I would daily skim all updates of some manga websites, to find those I'd like to read.

It's my way to relieve anxiety, sometime it works, sometimes it makes things worse.

I start to think like a creater or editor of manga, and post some of my ideas on twitter.


## 25

I am a bit proud that I use linux and free & open source software everyday. They serve me well.

Maybe saying "proud" is too arrogant, it's not something hard.

Be a contributor may be something more worth mentioning.


## 26

I tried engaging in development of "wine", An old and famous open source project, through a open-source promotion plan in this summer. I exchanged several email with my potential tutor, but wasn't selected.

I have another idea of that project and had written some code, and my tutor thought my idea may be valuable. But I procrastinated, didn't shape the code and push the task because I worried I was too novice, and I didn't have enough energy to do so.

And their mailing list sends too much email every day.


## 27 things that make me feel guilty 1

I send email to Professor Zhang of DAS Lab in the middle of the semester, he assign me something I am not interested in, and I feel anxious and do not show up until the end of the semester.

But in summer vacation I engaged in every group meeting, cooperating with a senior student, and made notable contribution on a KV research project.

This time, I still have some doubt on the Machine Learning part of the KV project, but I discussed with another senior student, finding out what I'm good at and take them. After all, it's relieved that the outcome is good.


## 28 things that make me feel guilty 2

After My internship at PingCAP was over, I promised My HR Miss Kong to write a blog post sharing my experience of internship. I don't write it until now.

At first I procrestinated. Then some impostor syndrome appears, I thought I hardly have any notable thing to say about my internship, I'm not as good as my colleges, especially those at the same age as me.

The longer it goes, the harder it is to start writing the post.


## 29 things that make me feel guilty 3

I was writing a slack message backup bot for the computer enthusiast's group.

But the progress is slow. When I back to my dormitory, I always feel tired and don't want to work on it.



## 30

I start to read more books in recent days. Hope it would be a better substitute to poking my phone screen.

I read a history book by Hobsbawm, some essay about India by Naipaul, and a book about sex therapist.


## 31

I feel I am lack of energy for many things, like social interaction or executing a plan.

Maybe I'm a little depressed.


## 32

I live a childhood without too much pressure from my family and the society.

I don't compete for elite primary school or secondary school. At that time kids mostly go to community school.

I have a childhood full of free time, collectable card game and fireworks.


## 33

I like surfing the internet, it might be the habit I kept for the longest time.

My other habits, reading manga, learning skills, and getting news, are based on the Internet.

But I build my friendship basically in my real life.


## 34

I can do most of the home cooking. Sometimes I would cook dinner for my family.

I like to watch cooking video on Youtube and Bilibili.


## 35

I like unix command line. I also think unix philosophy is a good thing, but I know that my opinion is not very valuable for I don't have too much pratical experience.

I put some effort on making all my tools's interface similiar, the configuration files about it are in my github repository ofey404/dotfiles.

I give my operating system, my text editor and browser a vim-style key binding, with which I can fully control them from keyboard.


## 37 RIP, Mr. Miura 1

I'm shocked when I heard the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga Berserk, at May 2021.

It seems to me that his posthumous work can never be finished, even by another manga artist.

Finish a famous posthumous manga is clearly a risky task, it can't make much profit or fame, and fans always feel unsatisified. No sane manga artist would take work like this.


## 38 RIP, Mr. Miura 2

But what if doujinshi, or in English, fan-fiction, can be created in the community working mode like open source software did?

Nowadays most of manga art is created by computer graphics, even Mr. Miura use CG in his latter years. But those digital project files still live like paper, sitting on their author's computer.

We still don't have a cooperation model for manga artists, like git for programmers.


## 39 RIP, Mr. Miura 3

The pixiv works well, as "an illustration communication service". But even in the Creative Commons License, only the final output - the image is shared, not how to create it.

It's just like learning other's software without source code. In the digital world, the layers, brush strokes, are naturally redistributable. We just miss a sutable tool to distribute them.


## 40 If there is such "git for manga artists"

There would be new possibilities for fan-fiction community, and even for professional artists.

It would be easier for fan community to continue a posthumous work. Even someone give up, their storyboard or image is still useful.

Learning to create artwork might be easier.


## 41

I suffered from backache those days.


## 42

Believe it or not, the password of my computer is about Aaron Swartz.


## 43

Now I'm learning digital illustration as a pastime.

I borrowed a graphic drawing tablet from a roommate, and learning to use krita.


## 44
