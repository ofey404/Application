### workshop

总体印象：
- communication skill 和 working ethic 是被学生反复提到的两个词。
  - 我对 working ethic 也有自己的想法，可以进一步了解。
- 对于 capstone project 的说明：
  - 形式：research, commercialize some research, or make a product.
  - 特点：
    - Provide a chance to learning from experience, by doing.
    - Real life challange, can be something global (like COVID or wild fire).
    - Inclusive teaming. The world has changed and there are some new challanges like remote working.
  - university leading or partner (industry) leading.
  - 2021: You can propose your project.
    - DDL: 1 month and a half (after what?)
    - 我的一个可以做的想法：Version control for visual artists?
    - 我还想了解有没有和 \*BSD 有关的开发机会。
