> The Master of Science (M.S.) Only program is a very small research program for exceptional applicants with research experience. The M.S. leads to a Ph.D. or a career in industrial R&D.  If you're sure that you want to continue on for a Berkeley Ph.D., you should consider applying to the MS/PhD program, since we admit so few people for the M.S. only, and you'll have to apply again to add the Ph.D.
