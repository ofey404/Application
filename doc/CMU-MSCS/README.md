What's in your application, and notes for specific programs, like:

> Master's in Computer Science Applicants 
>
> Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in computer science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in computer science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.
