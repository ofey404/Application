### Resume

Submit your current resume in PDF format. Any other format will not be accepted. Outline your education, research experience, work experience, publications, scholarships awarded, prizes and honors received, society memberships, and extracurricular activities. Include your name and User ID on the resume. 

### Statement of Purpose

Prepare a concise one or two page essay in PDF format that describes your primary areas of interest, your related experiences, and your objective in pursuing a graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon. Your essay should be specific in describing your interests and motivations. When describing your interests, you should explain why you think they are important areas of study and why you are particularly well-suited to pursue them. You should describe any relevant education, research, commercial, government, or teaching experience. If you are applying to more than one program, you may (but are not required to) submit a separate Statement of Purpose for each program. If you are submitting different statements, please upload as one file and include a table of contents page. Include your name and User ID on the essay. 

Notes for specific programs:

- Human-Computer Interaction Ph.D. applicants: Indicate your intended area of emphasis in the first paragraph of your Statement of Purpose. If appropriate to your background, you may include a link to your portfolio.
- Software Engineering applicants: Describe any team-oriented software development experiences you have had (if there are numerous examples pick 2 or 3). Briefly describe the nature of the projects, the general technologies involved, how many engineers were on your team, and describe your role on the team. Describe your short-term goals (2-4 years) and long-term goals (5-7 years) upon graduation from this academic program. Feel free to explain your goals in terms of relevant roles, domains, organizational technologies, expertise, and so forth. Describe specifically how the program to which you are applying, and Carnegie Mellon University more generally, aligns with your professional objectives.
- Societal Computing applicants: Indicate your intended area in the first paragraph of your Statement of Purpose along with the name of a possible advisor. For those with industrial or government experience, describe how this experience prepares you for graduate-level academic work. Submit this information in the Supplemental Information section under Experience (Research, Industry) in the online application. Applicants may also submit a short prior publication related to their research interests.
- Master's in Robotic Systems Development applicants: Provide some background information on your academic/industrial career to date, and why/how that leads you to be interested in CMU's unique industry-oriented MRSD program.  It would be helpful for the committee to understand your career aspirations, how you imagine the mix of technical/management education from MRSD would assist you in achieving these, and what you see yourself doing five to ten years after graduation.
- Master's in Computer Science applicants: Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in Computer Science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.
