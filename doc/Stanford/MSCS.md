> The MS program is excellent preparation for a career as a computer professional, or for future entry into a Ph.D. program at Stanford or elsewhere. Individual programs can be structured to consist entirely of coursework or to involve some research. For students more interested in research, an option for an "MS degree with distinction in research" has recently been added (see https://exploredegrees-nextyear.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/compute...).

什么是这里提到的 very strong student with insufficient background?

> However, very strong students with insufficient background for Ph.D. admission may choose to enter the MS program to gain additional experience, to demonstrate academic potential at Stanford, and perhaps to align with a faculty member in research.
