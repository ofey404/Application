Graduate Courses and their Area Classifications: https://cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/graduate-courses-and-their-area-classifications

In order for the University to consider your graduate application complete and eligible for review, you must upload the following three documents by your departmental application deadline.  You may submit and pay for your online application prior to uploading these documents.  However, please be aware that your application may be considered incomplete by the department, and therefore ineligible for review, if these documents are not uploaded by the departmental application deadline.  If you wish to upload some or all of your documents at a later time, you may proceed through the online application and log in later to complete document upload.  It is not necessary to mail hard copies of these documents to the department. In addition to the three required documents, you may optionally upload up to three additional supplemental documents. Please consult the requirements of the department/program that you are applying to for information on any additional documents that may be requested.

### Statement of Purpose

Give a brief statement outlining your reasons for undertaking a graduate program, your particular area of specialization within the major field, your past academic work, and your plans for future occupation or profession. Also include any additional information that may assist the selection committee in evaluating your preparation and aptitude for graduate study at UC Santa Barbara.

### Personal Achievements/Contributions Statement

UC Santa Barbara is interested in a diverse and inclusive graduate student population. Please describe any aspects of your personal background, accomplishments, or achievements that you feel are important in evaluating your application for graduate study. For example, please describe if you have experienced economic challenges in achieving higher education, such as being financially responsible for family members or dependents, having to work significant hours during undergraduate schooling or coming from a family background of limited income. Please describe if you have any unusual or varied life experiences that might contribute to the diversity of the graduate group, such as fluency in other languages, experience living in bicultural communities, academic research interests focusing on cultural, societal, or educational problems as they affect underserved segments of society, or evidence of an intention to use the graduate degree toward serving disadvantaged individuals or populations.
