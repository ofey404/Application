\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Writing sampling and logging code.
    \item Engaging in development, debugging and performance optimization.
\end{mySecondItemize}
\item Implemented a request sampling strategy to estimate load effectively in mica, inspired by Gprof.
\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Utilized fast timing (dozen of CPU cycles) with Time Stamp Register.
    \item Refactored the core module (processing) of mica, made it easier to read and develop.
    \item Ensured performance loss is little during refactoring, by running and recording benchmark after each commit.
    \item Cooperated with my collaborator with private github repository, manage progress by issues, PRs and projects.
\end{mySecondItemize}
\item Upgraded DPDK's incompatible API on mica's 30K line code base, by introducing a test framework.
\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Read the whole code base, had holistic understanding of the architecture of mica.
    \item Identified modules needed to be upgraded, by drawing a dependency map to clarify modules' relationship.
    \item Integrated an tiny test framework greatest.h into mica, finished upgrading in a week.
\end{mySecondItemize}

% \item Made a presentation about image embedding.

\end{rSubsection}

}

\item Built a metrics checker for TiDB's automated test. Still maintained and used in pipeline after I left.

\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Led the design and implementation with golang and Prometheus API.
    \item Wrote tests and passed code review, then integrated it into existed argo workflow pipeline and CI/CD tools.
    \item (It has been transferred to a private repository of PingCAP, so the project link is a snapshot.)
\end{mySecondItemize}

\item Simplified debugging TiDB inside k8s container by developing a tool along with my mentor.
\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Collected requirements from developers and got involved in the overall design.
    \item Prototyped in-container part with python and shell script, maintained the script generator with my mentor.
    \item Engaged in code review, maintenance and new feature request.
\end{mySecondItemize}
\item Accomplished end-to-end test with developers in the release of a major version on time.
\item Return offer.


% \item Made a presentation about fuzzing.

\end{rSubsection}


%--------Department of Optical Science-----------

\begin{rSubsection}
% P.S. Link of the paper mentioned:

\item Coded for data processing of a paper on computational material research in the name of third author.
\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Build automatic data processing pipeline for material calculation program VASP, and visualized data with python.
\end{mySecondItemize}
\item Trained all colleagues workflow of git and set up a private Gitlab. Still invited to give lectures about CS.
\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Set up a private Gitlab on lab's server with Docker, write documentations about how to use it.
    \item Gave lectures about git and basic linux tools.
\end{mySecondItemize}
\item Created some crawlers and scripts to aggregate data from several researchers' website. Still in use.
\begin{mySecondItemize}
    \item Wrote crawlers in scrapy to access public data files from some researchers' personal website.
    \item Wrote a bunch of python scripts to interact with multiple material databases' API. 
\end{mySecondItemize}
