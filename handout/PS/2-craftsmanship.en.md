Craftsmanship
=============

"Craftsmanship is a contagion, a kind of mental virus. You catch it by observing others and allowing the meme to take hold." said the book *The Clean Coder*, and I really appreciate this idea. As an interest-driven, self-taught programmer, I have various experiences in my four years' programming journey - Started by installation of Linux, I became an enthuasist, worked for hardware and computational physics labs, had an internship, and worked for an software lab until now. To get the most out of the master project, what I want most is to build up my craftsmanship, the mindset held by professional. 

"More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switch from the decipline of nature science to engineering. In math and science, a problem maybe too intrinsic, or require too much intellegence to push forward, but in engineering the size itself can be a problem. Currently I was working on a 30000 line codebase with a doctoral student. 30K lines written by an antecessor, and one collaborator, it's not a big amount, but without careful management, nothing meaningful could be done. Linux kernel and other huge open source projects has millions of codelines, and when a large amount of people collaborating together, the collaboration itself become a complex system to manage. Computer and software are the most complicated creations humankind ever made, just like some invisible cities. Luckily, in order to find my way, it's no need to know every room, every docoration on every wall, knowledge of map and signs is enough to begin. Here is the craftsmanship stands: To manage the complexity inherented in code and human activities.

Coding is more like writing a essay or painting rather than building a wall, for the core of coding is manipulating cascading concepts. Assembly overshadows gates, other languages build on concepts of assembly, then you write your own program, just like the way an essay was build. And few meaninful engineering product is build by clever code alone, since the knowledge and time required is often beyond the single human mind can hold. Three people can building the same wall at the same time, but the ordinary writers or painters won't work like that, so as the programmers. The collaboration model matters. I especially like what the free/open source community does, distributed version control, use issue and pull requests to persist the history. It's like painters each take responsibility of a figure in the whole picutre, and every meaningful stroke is recorded. I even tried to introduce this to non-CS related decpline, when I was in the computational physics lab. I set up a Gitlab instance on their server, gave lectures about git-based workflow, and wrote documentation in case I left. It was a boost of productivity, and even after I left, that Gitlab is still in use now. I pick the habit of working around Github repository during my Internship in PingCAP Inc., and it turned out to be a bonus when another graduated student come to help in my project in November. Since I use issues and pull requests to collaborate with my partner, record reasons of technical decition, do code review to remove unnecessary parts, there are always pages to which I can refer when he had doubts, many of them contained details I totally forgot. Stick to those I considered as craftsmanship expanded my ability beyond my limited working memories. "If you can't reduce it to a freshman level, you don't really understand it." said Richard Feynman, coding is expressing, and the craftsmanship is understand the nature of code and people around it, in order to make it clear enough. I even placed my application material in a public repository on GitHub, `ofey404/Application`, sharing them with anyone interested in, also forcing myself to prepare them structurally and clearly.

I was a wild programmer who have a hometown, a motherland which gave me the first passion. It's free and open-source software. I want to be a contributer, especially in the area of low level programming. My first exposure of programming was installing a Linux, according to a wiki page of the Physics Experiment Center of Fudan University. I never thought I would become a programmer before, but I was exciting when I was in the loop of describing the problem, searching, doing experiments, and analyzing the outcome. I was totally fascinated, it was love at the first sight. The computer world for me is not just an exhausting swamp, but land with good engineering products, friendly communities, and meaningful things that one's own hands can craft. The Great Firewall always block the official documentations and repositories, so I managed to bypass it with free and open-source software. This experience gave me much confidence and my standard ID `ofey404` is in memory of this (and Richard Feynman). I became an computer head since then.

"(TODO: Find the origin quote.)The products of technology are not really ugly...the true ugliness lies in the relationship between the people who invent the technology and the products they make." like the quote from *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, when the role of user and contributer are not seperated, there would be healthier relationships which can produce public goods. I use linux every day, so as various command line tools, package managers, and so on. They makes me happy, and memories about them are also delightful, that's the first reason that I want to contribute to free and open source software. Last year I was really fascinated about a command line cheatsheet tool, and when I miss a functionality, [I added it](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet/pull/161) by myself in a night. Hacking is happy, when being helped by reading others' code, the happiness doubled. Besides, almost every programmer is benefited by some public goods, I want to do something to generate them. Heard the news that OpenSSL is maintained by only one full-time contributor, I was shocked. It just like everyone benefits from the world tree, but only one gardener is taking care of the root. I don't suppose that volunteering is the only ethical or acceptable way, since I have working experience, and I know the world is shaped mostly by economical activities. Free software [emphasises social solidarityâ€”that is, sharing and cooperation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html), and open-source find a way to thrive along with the ecnomical world. Those two group people, though their ideas vary, they all love programming and hacking, and they are producing public goods that we enjoy. Public goods never comes from nothing, the previous generation contributed and left them to us. I feel obliged to do something, in order to pass this computer world I loved to the next generation. After all, the open-source collaboration model is well-tested for large scale software engineering, and the computer industry today is just like Painting in the Renaissance, or Physics in the early 20th century, it has a large capacity, it's broad-minded enough to accept various, ambitious people, let them do meaningful things. If I can get a job about free/open-source project, it's wonderful, if I cannot do so, I could found a "daytime-job" which would give me time and space to contribute to some public goods. And low level tools, like network protocol or operating system, they have unique impacts compared with applications. Application seldom make the computer more respect or dispise its users, but low-level tools did. Low level tools shape the computer world, and applications shape the rest.
