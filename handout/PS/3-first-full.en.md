## Target

[Berkeley - Graduate Research Degree Programs (M.S./Ph.D.)](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions)
[Graduate Admissions Frequently Asked Questions](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/faq)

### Requirement

- Statement of Purpose - Why are you applying for this program? What are your research goals and interests? What do you hope to accomplish in this degree program? What do you want to do after and how will this help you?
- Personal History Statement - What from your past made you decide to go into this field? And how will your personal history help you succeed in this program and your future goals?

### What is the difference between the Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement? How long should each essay be?

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests. The online application will provide you with some questions to help you write the essay, but other questions we recommend you consider addressing in your SOP are: Why are you applying to this program at UC Berkeley? What do you hope to accomplish at this institution? What are you research goals? How will your research impact you or others? What do you want to do after you receive your degree?

The Personal History Statement (PHS) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests in relation to your background/personal history. In addition to the online application prompt, some other questions you may want to address in your PHS are: How has your background influenced your academic goals, research interests, or desire to go into this field? How can your background help you succeed both in this program and with your future goals?

There is no minimum or maximum length requirement for either essay. Though many applicants aim for each essay to be between 500-1000 words or 1-2 pages. It's okay if there is a little overlap of information between the SOP and PHS.

I was an interest-driven programmer who want to build up my craftsmanship. Craftsmanship is the mindset held by professionals, including techniques, values and working ethics. I want to study in Berkeley MEng because I want to go beyond clever code, get the most out of your leadership modules and capstone project, to fulfill my dream of an free/open-source software leader. And on campus is important, because I want to build relations in and out classroom, working together with the brightest and observe them. Craftsmanship is a meme, we catch it by observing others and allowing the meme to take hold, said the book *The Clean Coder*.

"More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switch from the discipline of natural science to engineering. In math and science, a problem may be too intrinsic or require too much intelligence to push forward, but in engineering, when size is growing, code management and teamwork matters. I hope your Teaming and Project Management module could help me to handle those issues. Currently, I am working on a 30000 line codebase with a doctoral student. 30K lines written by a previous developer, one collaborator to work with, it's not a big amount, but I experienced much friction in development because of too much legacy code. And teamwork with github helps us to make it through (TODO: More details). Linux kernel and other massive open-source projects have millions of code lines, and when many people collaborate, the collaboration itself becomes a complex system to manage. Computer and software are the most complicated creations humankind ever made, just like some invisible cities. Luckily, to find my way, it's no need to know every room, every decoration on every wall, knowledge of maps and signs is enough to begin. I want to be better at managing the complexity inherent in code and human activities, that's important for me to be a real craftsman(professional.)

// TODO: Under construction below

Coding is more like writing an essay or painting rather than building a wall, for the core of coding is manipulating cascading concepts. Assembly overshadows gates, and other languages are built on concepts of assembly, then you write your own program, just like the way an essay was built. And few meaningful engineering products are made by clever code alone since the knowledge and time required is often beyond the single human mind can hold. Three people can build the same wall simultaneously, but the ordinary writers or painters won't work like that, so as the programmersâ€”the collaboration model matters. I especially like what the free/open source community does, distributed version control, use issues and pull requests to persist the history. It's like painters each takes responsibility for a figure in the whole picture, and every meaningful stroke is recorded. When I was in the computational physics lab, I tried to introduce this to non-CS related disciplines. I set up a Gitlab instance on their server, gave lectures about git-based workflow, and wrote documentation in case I left. It was a boost of productivity, and even after I left that Gitlab is still in use now. I picked the habit of working around Github repository during my Internship in PingCAP Inc. It turned out to be a bonus when another graduated student came to help with our project in November. Since I use issues and pull requests to collaborate with my partner, record reasons for technical decisions, and do code reviews to remove unnecessary parts, there were always pages to which I could refer when he had doubts. Many of them contained details I forgot. Stick to those I considered as craftsmanship expanded my ability beyond my limited working memories. "If you can't reduce it to a freshman level, you don't really understand it." said Richard Feynman. Coding is expressing, and craftsmanship is about understanding the nature of code and the people around it to make it clear enough. I even placed my application material in a public repository on GitHub, `ofey404/Application`, sharing them with anyone interested in, also forcing myself to prepare them structurally and clearly.

The capstone project *Vision Correcting Display (advisor Prof. Brian Barsky)* attracts me because I have high order aberration. I'm glad to join a project caring about people like me. And I also have some own ideas about my capstone project. I can propose them on your website. First, I want to build a version control system for visual artists to introduce the collaboration model of free/open-source world to the artists since so many illustrators are using computer graphics. Illustration sharing sites like *pixiv* only share the final output, and if the history and version can be shared like code at Github, creating and learning artworks are easier. Digital illustrations are naturally redistributable, and we just miss a suitable tool to distribute them and collaborate around them. I missed the early dead Miura Kentaro, *Berserk*'s author, and the fan community may be able to finish his posthumous work if we had a better collaboration model. In the time of Michelangelo, it's common for artists and apprentices to work on the same painting, but in today's manga and fan art, this collaboration is missing. There are some commercial products, but they are team-oriented and built around proprietary file format like PhotoShop's. What if we can provide them with handy tools, a free/open-source version control system on illustrations, and make the web a place of artists' global collaboration like programmers. Your Visual Computing and Computer Graphics Prospective could help me about that. Besides, I also want to work on operating systems since Berkeley is the origin of BSD.
