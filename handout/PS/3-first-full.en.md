First full version of Personal Statement
========================================

## Target

[Berkeley - Graduate Research Degree Programs (M.S./Ph.D.)](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions)
[Graduate Admissions Frequently Asked Questions](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/faq)

### Requirement

- Statement of Purpose - Why are you applying for this program? What are your research goals and interests? What do you hope to accomplish in this degree program? What do you want to do after and how will this help you?
- Personal History Statement - What from your past made you decide to go into this field? And how will your personal history help you succeed in this program and your future goals?

### What is the difference between the Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement? How long should each essay be?

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests. The online application will provide you with some questions to help you write the essay, but other questions we recommend you consider addressing in your SOP are: Why are you applying to this program at UC Berkeley? What do you hope to accomplish at this institution? What are you research goals? How will your research impact you or others? What do you want to do after you receive your degree?

The Personal History Statement (PHS) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests in relation to your background/personal history. In addition to the online application prompt, some other questions you may want to address in your PHS are: How has your background influenced your academic goals, research interests, or desire to go into this field? How can your background help you succeed both in this program and with your future goals?

There is no minimum or maximum length requirement for either essay. Though many applicants aim for each essay to be between 500-1000 words or 1-2 pages. It's okay if there is a little overlap of information between the SOP and PHS.

// 第一次写，duplicate information 不重要。先把东西写出来再安排。

I am an interest-driven programmer who wants to build up my craftsmanship. Craftsmanship is the mindset held by professionals, including techniques, values and work ethics. I want to master system and low-level programming skills. Berkeley MEng attracts me because I want to go beyond clever code, get the most out of your leadership modules and the capstone project to fulfil my dream of a free/open-source software leader. And on campus is essential because I want to build relations in and out the classroom, working together with the brightest and observing them. Craftsmanship is a meme, and we catch it by observing others and allowing the meme to take hold, said the book *The Clean Coder*. I also had a proposal for a capstone project - an open-source version control system for visual artists. It may fit the Data Science and Systems or Visual Computing and Computer Graphics concentration.

// 第一段感觉把后面想说的都说完了？先放着，等会再改。

Your ideas about the capstone project excite me. I regard myself as an indie hacker, and I was looking forward to some real-life challenges, a chance to learn by doing. I'm interested in project *Vision Correcting Display (advisor Prof. Brian Barsky)*. I have high order aberration, and I can see the potential in this project. Besides, what I want to propose is to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. In the open-source community, programmers collaborate around code and version control systems to learn and develop software. However, digital artists still do not have the tools to adapt the community collaboration model. Digital illustrations are naturally redistributable, just like code. We just miss a suitable tool to distribute and collaborate around them, like git or svn to programmers. Illustration sharing sites like *pixiv* only share the final output, and imagine what will happen if a learner can study the strokes of a shared picture, illustrators around the world can cooperate in a shared library just like coders at Github, or fanart communities can build something beyond the ability of one person or small teams! In the time of Michelangelo, it was common for artists and apprentices to work together closely. With the Internet, it's the time to unleash the power of social cooperation, just like what the free/open-source movement did in programming. I was in deep grief when I heard the death of Miura Kentaro, the author of the manga *Berserk*. It's too risky for another manga artist to take and finish it, and the fan art community usually cannot afford the long-term devotion. But with an accessible open-source illustration version control system, the fan art community can work together and effectively help each other, and this may be the only way we can give many great posthumous works a second life. There are some kinds of commercial products but not popular, and they are expensive and designed for teams working for companies. Since there are open-source painting programs like Krita, it's not an impossible task.

// 上面这段讲了我打算在 program 期间做什么。如果扩增的话也是往这个方向。

I want to lead significant software projects, have a holistic view of the computer system. I want to do low-level works that can touch the heart of the computer, not limited to operating systems but networks or databases. My work at CS lab is about a high-performance database, and I want to get my hands dirtier during my master's education. Your modules of leadership, teamwork and business are also attractive to me. "More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switch from the discipline of natural science to engineering. In math and science, a problem may be too intrinsic or require too much intelligence to push forward, but in engineering, when size is growing, code management and teamwork matter. Currently, I am working on a 30000 line codebase with a doctoral student. 30Klines written by a previous developer, one collaborator to work with, it's not a big amount, but I experienced much friction in development because of too much legacy code. I applied what I learned during my internship at an open-source company, using git and GitHub to track history, do experiments, and review code. Finally, we made it through the hardest time, and I realized that I needed more soft skills beyond clever code. Massive open-source projects, with so many people collaborating, they just like some invisible cities. Fortunately, to find my way, it's no need to know every room, every decoration on every wall. I jumped into this city with passion, and now I am urged for guidance. Your technical specialization and leadership courses would be my map.

// 上面这段：我在完成之后想做什么，并且这个项目能怎么帮到我

// TODO: Under construction below

I am applying to MEng at UC Berkeley, for ...

// 为什么我要申请 Berkeley MEng？有很大一部分材料没有组织进去，列在下面：

- 项目强调跨领域的合作，有和其他工程类专业方面的合作机会，大家都在一起；
  - 和我曾经的跨领域合作经历关联。我想做的事情之一（VCS for artists）倒是写进去了。
- Berkeley 是著名开源项目 *BSD 的发源地
  - 我想学到 low level 的东西，还有我对自由/开源软件的偏好都可以满足。
- 我看了你们的 information session，觉得氛围很好（这个可以再细化
- Want to work with the best and build my craftsmanship.
