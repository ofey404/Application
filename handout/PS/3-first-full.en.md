First full version of Personal Statement
========================================

## Target

[Berkeley - Graduate Research Degree Programs (M.S./Ph.D.)](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions)
[Graduate Admissions Frequently Asked Questions](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/faq)

### Requirement

- Statement of Purpose - Why are you applying for this program? What are your research goals and interests? What do you hope to accomplish in this degree program? What do you want to do after and how will this help you?
- Personal History Statement - What from your past made you decide to go into this field? And how will your personal history help you succeed in this program and your future goals?

### What is the difference between the Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement? How long should each essay be?

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests. The online application will provide you with some questions to help you write the essay, but other questions we recommend you consider addressing in your SOP are: Why are you applying to this program at UC Berkeley? What do you hope to accomplish at this institution? What are you research goals? How will your research impact you or others? What do you want to do after you receive your degree?

The Personal History Statement (PHS) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests in relation to your background/personal history. In addition to the online application prompt, some other questions you may want to address in your PHS are: How has your background influenced your academic goals, research interests, or desire to go into this field? How can your background help you succeed both in this program and with your future goals?

There is no minimum or maximum length requirement for either essay. Though many applicants aim for each essay to be between 500-1000 words or 1-2 pages. It's okay if there is a little overlap of information between the SOP and PHS.

关于 SOP 和 PHS 另有两段描述，在选校报告中有摘录，复录如下：

**Statement of Purpose**

Please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization, including your preparation for this field of study, your academic plans or research interests, and your future career goals. Please be specific about why UC Berkeley would be a good intellectual fit for you.

**Personal History Statement**

Please describe how your personal background and experiences influenced your decision to pursue a graduate degree. In this section, you may also include any relevant information on the following:

(Please note that the Personal History Statement should not duplicate the Statement of Purpose)

// 第一次写，duplicate information 不重要。先把东西写出来再安排。

I was an interest-driven programmer who want to build up my craftsmanship. Craftsmanship is the mindset held by professionals, including techniques, values and working ethics. I want to master system and low-level programming skills. Berkeley MEng attacts me because I want to go beyond clever code, get the most out of your leadership modules and capstone project, to fulfill my dream of an free/open-source software leader. And on campus is important, because I want to build relations in and out classroom, working together with the brightest and observe them. Craftsmanship is a meme, we catch it by observing others and allowing the meme to take hold, said the book *The Clean Coder*. I also had a proposal for capstone project - open-source version control system for visual artists, it may fit the Data Science and Systems or Visual Computing and Computer Graphics concentration.

// 第一段感觉把后面想说的都说完了？先放着，等会再改。

Your ideas about capstone project excites me. I regard myself as an indie hacker, and I was looking forward to some real life challange, a chance to learning by doing. I'm interested in project *Vision Correcting Display (advisor Prof. Brian Barsky)*. I have high order aberriation, and I can see the potential in this project. Besides, what I really want to propose is to build a open-source version control system for digital illustrations. In open-source community, prorammers collaborate around code and version control system to learn and build new softwares, but digital artists still do not have tools to adapt the community collobation model. Digital illustrations are natually redistributable, just like code, we just miss a suitable tool to distribute and collaborate around them, like git or svn to programmers. Illustration sharing sites like *pixiv* only share the final output, and imagine what will happen if a learner can study the strokes of a shared picture, illustrators around the world can cooperate together in a shared library just like coders at Github, or fanart communities can build something beyond the ability of one person or small teams! In the time of Michelangelo, it's common for artists and apprentices to work together closely, and with the Internet, it's the time to unleash the power of social cooperation, just like what free/open-source movement did in programming. I was in deep grief when I heard the death of Miura Kentaro, the author of manga *Berserk*. It's too risky for another manga artist to take and finish it, and fan art community usually cannot afford the long-term devotion. But with an accessable open-source illustration version control system fan art community can work together and help each other in an effective manner, and this may be the only way we can give many great posthumous work a second life. There are some kinds of commercial products but not popular, and they are expensive and designed for teams working for companies. Since there are open-source painting programs like krita, it's not a impossible task.

// 上面这段讲了我打算在 program 期间做什么。如果扩增的话也是往这个方向。

I want to lead significant software projects, have a holistic view of the computer system. I want to do low-level works that can touch the heart of the computer, not limited to operating systems but networks or databases. My work at CS lab is about a high-performance database, and I want to get my hands dirtier during my master's education. Your modules of leadership, teamwork and business is also attractive to me. "More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switch from the discipline of natural science to engineering. In math and science, a problem may be too intrinsic or require too much intelligence to push forward, but in engineering, when size is growing, code management and teamwork matters. Currently, I am working on a 30000 line codebase with a doctoral student. 30K lines written by a previous developer, one collaborator to work with, it's not a big amount, but I experienced much friction in development because of too much legacy code. I applied what I learnt during my internship of open-source company, use git and github to track history, do experiment and review code. Finally we make it through the hardest time, and I realized that I need more soft skills beyond clever code. Massive open-source projects, with so many people collaborating, they just like some invisible cities. Fortunately, to find my way, it's no need to know every room, every decoration on every wall. I jump into this city with passion, and now I am urged for guidance. Your technical specialization and leadership courses would be my map.
