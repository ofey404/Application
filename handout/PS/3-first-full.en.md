First full version of Personal Statement
========================================

## Target

[Berkeley - Graduate Research Degree Programs (M.S./Ph.D.)](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions)

### Requirement

- Statement of Purpose - Why are you applying for this program? What are your research goals and interests? What do you hope to accomplish in this degree program? What do you want to do after and how will this help you?
- Personal History Statement - What from your past made you decide to go into this field? And how will your personal history help you succeed in this program and your future goals?

### What is the difference between the Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement? How long should each essay be?

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests. The online application will provide you with some questions to help you write the essay, but other questions we recommend you consider addressing in your SOP are: Why are you applying to this program at UC Berkeley? What do you hope to accomplish at this institution? What are you research goals? How will your research impact you or others? What do you want to do after you receive your degree?

The Personal History Statement (PHS) is the place for you to discuss your academic goals and research interests in relation to your background/personal history. In addition to the online application prompt, some other questions you may want to address in your PHS are: How has your background influenced your academic goals, research interests, or desire to go into this field? How can your background help you succeed both in this program and with your future goals?

There is no minimum or maximum length requirement for either essay. Though many applicants aim for each essay to be between 500-1000 words or 1-2 pages. It's okay if there is a little overlap of information between the SOP and PHS.
