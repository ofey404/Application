Statement Of Purpose and Personal History Statement
===================================================

整合了上一个版本 [3-first-full.en.md](3-first-full.en.md) 的内容，吸取了经验教训，呈现一个更加完整通顺的版本。更加像一个完整的 essay 的版本。

上一个版本的问题在于非常散，句和句之间失去了联系，一段之内不知道中心要表达什么。这是由写作方式决定的，不应该按着问题清单一个个回答过去，唯恐漏掉些什么，那样子不算是在写文章。故这次整理了思路，以写一篇论说文的形式呈现。

Statement Of Purpose 围绕我想要做的项目：A version control system for visual artists 展开。它能带来什么影响，为什么是可行的，我将会怎么做，学校能给我什么帮助，以及项目结束之后我打算去干什么。暂时先悬搁『做不做得到』这个判断，应该是读者来给出自己的看法，而我作为论说文的写作者要努力证明它是有意义的，可行的。

Personal History Statement 讲述我的来龙去脉，阐明它们和我要做的事情的关系。联系可以是我的想法是怎么产生的，我对项目、项目涉及到的概念的理解和经验，我过往经历中展示的能力，我为什么可以做到我想做的事情。

## Statement Of Purpose

I am excited to hear that students can propose capstone projects in 2021, and I bring my dream project: A open-source version control system for digital illustrations. As an indie hacker and a fan of manga, I believe we can unleash the potential in digital illustration art creation if the right tool is there. And now is the right time to build it.

Digital illustrations could be distributed like open-source code, but now they are just like printed papers. Even in illustration sharing sites like *pixiv*, artworks are shared in the final output figure file format. In the free/open-source community area, code can be studied, inspected, and reused, and these workflows built around version control form the basis of the planet's most extensive collaboration. Digital illustrations could have those merits. After all, Creative Commons licenses and illustration sharing sites have cleared the way for illustrators to learn from each other's work.

An open-source version control system would change the way we enjoy and create digital illustrations. Most obviously, it would be easier for enthusiasts to learn skills if they could study exactly how professional artists work, how certain effects are made, and how a design is refined through commit histories. Besides, with VCS, remote artists can work together more smoothly through the Internet. In the time of Michelangelo, it was common for artists to work on the same mural, and modern manga artists and their apprentices did so. If remote illustrators could efficiently work together, we would get more and better artwork.

What's more, VCS means more than yet another productivity tool; it can lay the foundation for a new social collaboration model in online artist communities, especially fan-art. Like what git and GitHub have done to programmers, asynchronous and fine-grained collaboration could be introduced to illustrators. It would be a breeze to contribute storyboards, figures, backgrounds, or other improvements, as long as there are proper licenses to protect the creator. Last but not least, VCS can give many unfinished works a second life. This idea of VCS first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If the fan-fiction community could come together, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a better ending. And an accessible open-source VCS would be the best way.

There are many things I can do right now, and I have taken several steps. I can learn how version control was implemented by reading materials about git internals and how the painting software's project file was arranged. I can get much information from an open-source painting software called Krita, and I'm learning to use it. I can talk to my artist friends and collect their ideas. I draw in my spare time. And the honorable MEng project at Stanford can give me more.

Two of your areas of concentration attract me: *Visual Computing and Computer Graphics*and *Data Science and Systems*. Building a (probably distributed) version control system for digital illustration needs knowledge from both of them. *CS 260A. User Interface Design and Development* would help me build the interface of the tool, and *CS 284A. Foundations of Computer Graphics* can build up a solid understanding of computer graphics for me.

Developing an open-source VCS of illustrations is beyond clever code, and I find what I need in your Engineering Leadership Modules. Running an open-source project means communicating with users, collaborating with strangers, and forming a reliable team. I only have experience working alone or in small groups. Your *Teaming & Project Management* and *Communications* module could get me on track more quickly. Besides, open-source projects require more knowledge about marketing because it relies on users. To make a popular open-source project, or just to get some users, I must know my users' needs, understand what a good product means, and how to publicize my project, so I need your *Marketing & Product Development* module. And to design my VCS, I should know what can be done with cutting-edge technology and the best practice. I think your *Industry Analysis* module could help me.


## Personal History Statement

I was an interest-driven programmer, a free/open-source lover, and a fan of manga. Starting from Linux, programming generally shifted from a hobby to my career in four years. I cherish today's digital world supported by free/open-source software, so I want to develop more. And the productivity behind free/open-source software is the social collaboration model, and I want to introduce this power to non-CS areas, especially the illustrator's community.

I never thought I would become a programmer until I met Linux at 18, on a wiki page of the Physics Experiment Center of Fudan University, and this makes me rethink my ideas about technology and people. As a physics freshman, I didn't have much knowledge of computers then, but I finally made it work on my laptop through the loop of search, experiment, and analysis. I was fascinated, not only because I felt confident and strong but also because I realized there were so many friendly strangers in the computer world. In the next few years, I worked for three labs and an open-source company, exploring my maximum possibilities. The more I programed, the more I believed that the heart of software engineering is beyond clever code - it's a story of managing concepts, communication, and social collaboration.

Meaningful engineering product is often beyond one person's time, and knowledge can handle, so I was always finding better ways to pass knowledge to another and work together. I recorded experiment videos in the SOC lab as a TA three years ago so that newcomers could watch them even I left. I picked up the habit of organizing my work in a GitHub repository during my internship in PingCAP Inc., and it turned out to be a bonus in my recent research with a doctoral student. Sticking to my discipline, I use issues and pull requests to collaborate with my partner, record reasons for technical decisions, and do code reviews to remove unnecessary parts. When another graduated student came to this small team, I found that there were always web pages I could refer to when he had doubts. Many of them even contained details I forgot.

"More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switch from the discipline of natural science to engineering. The collaboration can be a problem when I worked on a 30Klines codebase(based on github.com/efficient/mica2) with two graduate students. And the massive free/open-source projects, like the Linux kernel, they like some invisible cities. To find our ways, we do not need to know every room, every decoration on every wall. We follow the signs and maps. It's the collaboration model and tools that made today's incredible huge free/open-source projects possible.

*The collaboration model, built around version control systems, might benefit other creative works if applied right because coding is about managing cascading concepts and explaining them in the right way. Coding a creative task like painting or writing an essay, and that's a well-tested model to let creators work together.*(TODO: Refactor this) Two years ago, I tried to introduce version control to the computational physics lab in which I worked. I set up a Gitlab instance on their server, gave lectures about git-based workflow, and wrote documentation. Some of my colleagues used it to manage code, and others stored slides and notes on it. Even after I left, the Gitlab instance is still in active use. Last month they invited me to give a lecture about git to their newcomers. I was glad to see it works as a productivity tool in a non-CS workplace. 

// 上下两段可以合在一起并且减少字数？

I was a manga fan, and I am keep thinking if more collaboration can change the game, especially the fan-fiction community. A few years ago, the best animators in Japan came together and produced the incredible *One Punch Man Season 1*. But manga artists often work alone or with a few apprentices. And especially fan-fiction artists, that's why fan fictions are usually short and lacks consistency, even they emerge from a relatively extensive community base. What if we put an accessible and suitable tool into their hands? Besides, it would also make learning to draw easier. After I came up with the idea, I took a drawing lesson. By watching my classmates, I learned a large number of techniques. So if we have a VCS, the working detail of those who are willing to share would be accessible to more people.
