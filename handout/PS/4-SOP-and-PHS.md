Statement Of Purpose and Personal History Statement
===================================================

整合了上一个版本 [3-first-full.en.md](3-first-full.en.md) 的内容，吸取了经验教训，呈现一个更加完整通顺的版本。更加像一个完整的 essay 的版本。

上一个版本的问题在于非常散，句和句之间失去了联系，一段之内不知道中心要表达什么。这是由写作方式决定的，不应该按着问题清单一个个回答过去，唯恐漏掉些什么，那样子不算是在写文章。故这次整理了思路，以写一篇论说文的形式呈现。

Statement Of Purpose 围绕我想要做的项目：A version control system for visual artists 展开。它能带来什么影响，为什么是可行的，我将会怎么做，学校能给我什么帮助，以及项目结束之后我打算去干什么。暂时先悬搁『做不做得到』这个判断，应该是读者来给出自己的看法，而我作为论说文的写作者要努力证明它是有意义的，可行的。

Personal History Statement 讲述我的来龙去脉，阐明它们和我要做的事情的关系。联系可以是我的想法是怎么产生的，我对项目、项目涉及到的概念的理解和经验，我过往经历中展示的能力，我为什么可以做到我想做的事情。

## Statement Of Purpose

I am excited to hear that students can propose capstone projects in 2021, and I bring my dream project: A open-source version control system for digital illustrations. As an indie hacker and a fan of manga, I believe we can unleash the potential in digital illustration art creation if the right tool is there. And now is the right time to build it.

Digital illustrations could be distributed like open-source code, but now they are just like printed papers. Even in illustration sharing sites like *pixiv*, artworks are shared in the final output figure file format. In the free/open-source community area, code can be studied, inspected, and reused, and these workflows built around version control form the basis of the planet's most extensive collaboration. Digital illustrations could have those merits. Creative Commons licenses and illustration sharing sites have cleared the way for illustrators to learn from each other's work, and now it's the time to push the collaboration forward further.

An open-source version control system would change the way we enjoy and create digital illustrations. It would be easier for enthusiasts to learn skills if they could study exactly how professional artists work, how certain effects are made, and how a design is refined through commit histories. With VCS, remote artists can work together more smoothly through the Internet. In the time of Michelangelo, it was common for artists to work on the same mural, and modern manga artists and their apprentices did so. With proper licenses to protect the creator, an accessible version control tool can reshape online artist communities, especially fan-art communities. VCS provides the possibility of asynchronous and fine-grained collaboration, which means it would be easier for people to contribute storyboards, figures, backgrounds, or other improvements. This idea first hit me when I heard the early death of Miura Kentaro, a famous manga artist. If there were such a VCS, many great posthumous works could have a second life, and more high-quality fan-fiction could be made. Besides, an open-source VCS would be as accessible as possible and would not be constrained by one file format or one painting software.

There are many things I can do right now, and I have taken several steps. I can learn how version control was implemented by reading materials about git internals and how the painting software's project file was arranged. I can get much information from an open-source painting software called Krita, and I'm learning to use it. I can talk to my artist friends and collect their ideas. I draw in my spare time. And the honorable MEng project at Stanford can give me more.

Two of your areas of concentration attract me: *Visual Computing and Computer Graphics*and *Data Science and Systems*. Building a (probably distributed) version control system for digital illustration needs knowledge from both of them. *CS 260A. User Interface Design and Development* would help me build the interface of the tool, and *CS 284A. Foundations of Computer Graphics* can build up a solid understanding of computer graphics for me.

Developing an open-source VCS of illustrations is beyond clever code, and I find what I need in your Engineering Leadership Modules. Running an open-source project means communicating with users, collaborating with strangers, and forming a reliable team. I only have experience working alone or in small groups. Your *Teaming & Project Management* and *Communications* module could get me on track more quickly. Besides, open-source projects require more knowledge about marketing because it relies on users. To make a popular open-source project, or just to get some users, I must know my users' needs, understand what a good product means, and how to publicize my project, so I need your *Marketing & Product Development* module. And to design my VCS, I should know what can be done with cutting-edge technology and the best practice. I think your *Industry Analysis* module could help me.

// 上一段需要扩写。这里也是展现 More is different 这种对于工程的理解（）的时候。

In my future career, I want to lead significant software projects (free/open-source is better), and do low-level works that can touch the heart of computer. Berkeley have a glorious history in free/open-source, for its BSD operating system and license.

// TODO: Future career 还有什么样的话题可以写呢？

## Personal History Statement

I was an interest-driven programmer, a free/open-source supporter and a manga lover. Started with the installation of Linux, I stepped into the land of programming four years ago. As programming generally shifted from my hobby to career, I enjoyed common goods created from free/open-source community, and my willing to participant grew. The real power behind free/open-source software is the social collaboration model, and I want to introduce this power to the illustrator's community

Raw materials

I worked in three labs: embedded system, computational physics then software, and had an internship in an open-source company.

I'm finding chance to .., or introduce the power of social collaboration to other area.

The real power lies behind free/open-source software is the collaboration model, and it's power is beyond the area of programming.

that's the very thing I understand in my track of programming.
