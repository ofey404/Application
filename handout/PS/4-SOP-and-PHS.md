Statement Of Purpose and Personal History Statement
===================================================

整合了上一个版本 [3-first-full.en.md](3-first-full.en.md) 的内容，吸取了经验教训，呈现一个更加完整通顺的版本。更加像一个完整的 essay 的版本。

上一个版本的问题在于非常散，句和句之间失去了联系，一段之内不知道中心要表达什么。这是由写作方式决定的，不应该按着问题清单一个个回答过去，唯恐漏掉些什么，那样子不算是在写文章。故这次整理了思路，以写一篇论说文的形式呈现。

Statement Of Purpose 围绕我想要做的项目：A version control system for visual artists 展开。它能带来什么影响，为什么是可行的，我将会怎么做，学校能给我什么帮助，以及项目结束之后我打算去干什么。暂时先悬搁『做不做得到』这个判断，应该是读者来给出自己的看法，而我作为论说文的写作者要努力证明它是有意义的，可行的。

## Statement Of Purpose

I am excited to hear that students can propose capstone projects in 2021, and I bring my dream project: A open-source version control system for digital illustrations. As an indie hacker and a fan of manga, I believe that we can unleash the potential in digital illustration art creation if the right tool is there. And now is the right time to build it.

Digital illustration could have been distributed like open-source code, but now they just like printed papers. Even in illustration sharing site like *pixiv*, artworks are shared in the format of the final output figure file. In the area of free/open-source community, code can be studied, inspected and reused, and these workflows built around version control form the basis of the planet's largest collaboration. Digital illustration could have those merits. Creative common licenses and illustration sharing sites have cleared the way for illustrators to learn from each other's work, and now it's the time to push the collaboration forward further.

A version control system would change the way we enjoy and create digital illustrations. It would be easier for enthusiasts to learn skills, if they can study exactly how professional artists work, how certain effects is created and how a desin is refined, through commit histories. With VCS, remote artists can work together more smoothly through the Internet. In the time of Michelangelo, it was common for artists to work on the same mural, and modern mangaists and their apprentices do so. With proper licences to protect the creator, a accessible version control tool can reshape online artist communities, especially fan-art communities. VCS provide the possibility of asynchronous and fine-grained collaboration, which means it would be easier for people to contribute storyboards, figures, backgrounds or other improvements. This idea first hit me when I heard the early death of Miura Kentaro, a famous manga artist. If there were such a VCS, so many great posthumous works could have a second life.
