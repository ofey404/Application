## Personal History Statement

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together, that's what I believe in my four years' programming experience. I started programming by trying to install Linux by myself. With the help of documentation and friendly strangers in the web, I finally made it. Year by year, I was more connected with the free/open-source software communities. I use Linux every day, build and study code from Github, and sometimes contribute to some tiny tools I like. I enjoy public goods produced by Free/open-source community, so as most programmers. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is a healthy relationship between technology and people, developers and users. And it's the accessible version control systems, like git or svn, that make today's mass collaboration around the globe succeed. I have a dream to pass this computer world I loved to the next generation, with more public goods and healthier relationship between people and technology.

I am also interested in art, especially visual art like digital illustration or manga, that's why I come up with the idea of building a version control system for illustrators. This semester, I took a sketching lesson as a layman. By observing my experienced classmates, I built up skills, then I realized that it's similar to study open-source code. But there is no mass direct collaboration in illustrators, though today's illustration creation is highly digitalized. I wonder if the insights in free/open-source collaboration could be applied to visual arts. What's more, according to Walter Benjamin, (tech) could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes. A accessible version control system may have new repercussions in visual art.

For two reasons I believe that version control system can be a benefit to other creative works: First of all, coding is about managing cascading concepts and express them in the right and clear way. It's a common pattern in creative works, so version control could be a general way to manage materials. Besides, nowadays creative works are unprecendented electronic-based, especially during the pandemic. With proper software, they could be version-controled. Two years ago, I introduced version control to the computational physics lab I worked then, and it turned out to be a real productivity tool. I set up a private Gitlab instance, gave lectures and wrote documentations for my colleagues. Some of them used it to manage code, some store slides, note or draft of paper. It is in active use even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the invitation of their supervisor. Version control is a real treasure chest for creators, since the workflow built around it is well tested by free/open-source community for years.
