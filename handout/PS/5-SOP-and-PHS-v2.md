## Personal History Statement

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together, that's what I believe in my four years' programming experience. I started programming by trying to install Linux by myself. With the help of documentation and friendly strangers in the web, I finally made it. Year by year, I was more connected with the free/open-source software communities. I use Linux every day, build and study code from Github, and sometimes contribute to some tiny tools I like. I enjoy public goods produced by Free/open-source community, so as most programmers. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is a healthy relationship between technology and people, users and developers. And it's the accessible version control systems, like git or svn, that make today's mass collaboration around the globe succeed. In my dream, I want to pass this computer world I loved to the next generation, with more public goods and healthier relationship between people and technology.
