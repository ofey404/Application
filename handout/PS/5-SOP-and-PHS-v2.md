## Personal History Statement

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together, that's what I believe in my four years' programming experience. I started programming by trying to install Linux by myself. With the help of documentation and friendly strangers in the web, I finally made it. Year by year, I was more connected with the free/open-source software communities. I use Linux every day, build and study code from Github, and sometimes contribute to some tiny tools I like. I enjoy public goods produced by Free/open-source community, so as most programmers. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is a healthy relationship between technology and people, developers and users. And it's the accessible version control systems, like git or svn, that make today's mass collaboration around the globe succeed. I have a dream to pass this computer world I loved to the next generation, with more public goods and healthier relationship between people and technology.

I am also interested in art, especially visual art like digital illustration or manga, that's why I come up with the idea of building a version control system for illustrators. This semester, I took a sketching lesson as a layman. By observing my experienced classmates, I built up skills, then I realized that it's similar to study open-source code. But there is no mass direct collaboration in illustrators, though today's illustration creation is highly digitalized. I wonder if the insights in free/open-source collaboration could be applied to visual arts. What's more, according to Walter Benjamin, (tech) could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes. A accessible version control system may have new repercussions in visual art.
