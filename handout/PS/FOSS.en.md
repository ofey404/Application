*This is the first PS I've written.*

I'm Weiwen Chen, 23 years old, equipped with a ThinkPad T14 with fedora linux 34. Five years studying physics, I started programming four years ago and was totally fascinated. I have work experience in three labs, two of them are closely related to computer hardware and software, and I also have been an intern of an open source database company PingCAP. However, I never thought I would become a programmer before 18, until I met linux. From a tiny manual page on the wiki of Physics Experiment Center, I went across the Great Firewall with the help of free software, becoming an enthusiast then a professional (though immature) programmer.

Now I am urged to get a master degree of computer science, there are multiple calls driving me. I am longing for the best computer science courses, just like those MOOCs I've finished from the world's top CS schools. I also desired a solid knowledge which can make me capable of the deepest forest of system and low-level programming areas. I want to have the capability to help the free and open source community, since they produced so much common good and enlightened my digital life, I should help.

The Internet, Chinese part in the first 10 years of 21st century, is the place that I grown up. My use of computer was limited to 30 minutes per week, according to an agreement with my father who thought things on the web are craps. I partially agree with him, though he knew nothing about tech. Chinese part of the Internet is not a geek-friendly place, especially ten years ago. It lacked public utilities. If you searched anything about tech, you would get a list of advertisements or bad-written blog posts which allures you to bad training classes. Official documentations would be behind three or more pages, often blocked by the Great Firewall, leaving a swamp of crude digital entertainment, pop ups and virus files. I would rather do something more meaningful than scavenge in a trash can, so I participated in Chinese Physics Olympiad at high school, then entered Fudan University, department of physics. There were some clues, like unusual passion I had on programmable calculator used in Physics Olympiad, or my preference on books like *Hacker and Painter*, *Neuromancer* or *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, but I never weaved all things together.

The first webpage about linux I read was an installation guide of ubuntu 17.04, on the wiki of Physics Experiment Center. It was so detailed, as if the writer was sitting by my side teaching me, so I decided to try it. I don't have much knowledge about computer then, but I found myself very comfortable executing the loop of exploring it - Describe the problem, search, do experiments then evaluate the result.

// I want to express the link between my nature science background and interst in computer science.

The pages about linux, even Chinese pages, they seems to be written by friendly people willing to help. Computer is by your side so you can explore anytime you like, solving problems by your own effort and kind help from strangers in the web, even the system welcomes your exploration. The sense of accomplishment overwhelmed me. ubuntu 17.04 is an unstable version that have many extra problems, the source of package manager even polluted by the Great Firewall, but the more difficulties I met, I was more confident about that I can finally solve them. I even managed to bypass the Great Firewall by a pipeline of open source software, which information was censored and confused under the Great Firewall itself. It was the love at first sight, it made me know that the world of computer is not just a exausting swamp, but a land which have good engineering products, friendly tech communities, and something can be acomplished by one's own hand.

// I want to emphasis that "something which can be acomplished by one's own hand".

After that I learnt my first programming language python, then the second, c, then the third and the forth. I volunteered on PC service team, offering consultancy on python and system management, worked for a SOC and software lab, took lessons opened by department of computer and MOOC opened by MIT and Stanford.

I appreciated the ideas I witnessed in the community of free/open source software. In my workplaces, I did something to improve the way people working together. As TA of System On Chip Lab, I organized teaching material into a textbook, and recorded videos about experiments in the book. In Computational Physics Lab, I introduced the collaberation workflow of git to my colleagues, set up a Gitlab instance, and write documentation in case of I left. Besides, for about two years, I spent my Thursday evening on volunteering at PC Service Group, giving consultancy to my schoolmates on python and general system management. And experiences of collaberation also benefits my own work, during my internship in PingCAP Inc., I learnt workflow based on github issue and pull request, and this works well in my current cooperation with a doctoral student. "One for all and all for one", though the reality is not always so romantic, it can produce considerable public good and healthier relationship between users and contributers, when the two roles are not seperated.

Heard the news that OpenSSL is maintained by only one full-time contributor, I was shocked. It just like everyone benefits from the world tree, but only one gardener is taking care of the root. I enjoyed so many other people's contribution, from operating system, software, tech blogs, and MOOCs, I want to do something for those public goods. I don't suppose that volunteering is the only ethical or acceptable way, since I have working experience, and I know the world is shaped mostly by economical activities, even Richard M. Stallman said, "free software can be commercial". I just mean that one should spend some of effort on something other than money, when the pressure of survive is not so harsh. I grew up at the Chinese net 10 years ago, close my eyes and I can recall what was like under the lack of public goods. The nightmare should never happen again. The previous generation contributed and left us public goods to enjoy. There are something should be done, to proudly pass today's computer world I loved to the next generation.
