Apart from propose my own project, I would choose an alternative project.

I'm also quite adaptive for other faculty and partner projects


### Gain Technical Expertise and Leadership Skills

A Master's degree is an essential beginning for a long-term career in Electrical Engineering and in Computer Science.

A Master's degree will allow you a deeper technical specialization, giving you both a head start in your career and a long-term advantage by making it easier for you to track new developments and change direction in your career.

Berkeley's Master of Engineering program goes beyond technical specialization to offer courses in engineering leadership and a team-oriented capstone project.

The project allows you to practice, with guidance, the technical and non-technical skills that you learn in the classroom.

Our M.Eng. in EECS program offers innovative graduate courses on scientific and technical topics, organized by technical concentrations that match your interest.
