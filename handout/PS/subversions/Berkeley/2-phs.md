"More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switch from natural science to engineering. Developing software is not a noun; instead, it's a verb phrase, composed with two complicated factor: technology and people. My journey is guided by them, and I am seeking leadership and teamwork in your program.

In QA team of PingCAP, I sold the idea of metrics-checker to my colleagues by research and presentation, and delivered it with close collaboration of my mentor Shaowen. It was a test infra written in Golang, based on my observation that some metrics in TiDB can reveal test coverage. To prove it's beneficial and viable, I studied existed optional solution like prometheus's AlertManager, and made a presentation on daily stand-up. I own the task, and deliver it with intensive requirement collection, study open-source code, design and redesign, while my mentor observed and judged my decision by constant code review. Though it's a small team, I got an hand-on experience on what teamwork can produce.

I also learnt a good design can do more with less through the outcome of metrics-checker, which went far beyond my expectation by its flexibility. By offloading logic to yaml config file, the checker itself acts as an executor, which made it data-driven and easy to deploy. Also, the separation of mechanism and strategy make it easy to be applied to other task. It turned out to be a handy tool, widely deployed in the test pipeline, and still maintained and upgraded even after I left. And during the close mentorship with my mentor, I realize the importance of systematic approaches in delivering software, which I could pick up in your project. Craftsmanship is the mindset held by professionals, it can be learnt by keep observing and doing.

I enjoy public goods produced by the Free/open-source community, and I am trying to generate some. My GitHub account is ofey404, sometimes I contribute to the tools I like. Recently I joined GNU's Chinese translation mailing list and began to submit reviews. There is no wall around those collaborations, so I engage in to do what I can right now. I have a dream, to pass this computer world I loved to the next generation, with more public goods and healthier relationships between people and technology.

"Information is power," Aaron Swartz said, and I would contribute to diversity by focusing on accessibility. The mode of Git, distributed open-source version control, is proved to be effective in passing invisible wall. My common ID 'ofey404' is to remind the big day I bypassed the Great Firewall with open-source software. I won't be another brick in the wall, a self-serving elite, because I know how information is poisoned and people are divided. My VCS project is focused on disseminating knowledge, and I believe I can motivate my classmates to be more informed citizens.
