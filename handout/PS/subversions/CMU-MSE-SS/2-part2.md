Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belief since my first exposure to programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers on the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people work together, a healthy relationship. In the age of remote work, it's time to apply insights from free/open-source software to other non-CS areas. I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. I explored popular illustration sharing sites like *pixiv* while learning to sketch, but artworks are shared in the final output figure file format, rather than shared by source like *GitHub*. Illustrators could have all merits programmers have enjoyed in open-source collaboration if the right tool is put into their hands.

As Walter Benjamin said, tech could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes. With an accessible VCS, enthusiasts could study exactly how professionals work. Remote artists can work together, just like Michelangelo and his apprentices working on the same mural. What's more, VCS would go further beyond yet another productivity tool, even beyond an art academy without walls. "Given enough eyeballs, all innovations will come out," by unleashing the power of social collaboration, a healthy community could make unprecedented large-scale projects. This idea first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If there were a VCS, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a second life.

I want to be a tech leader, lead such a open-source project.

leaders of the future who understand the technical, economic, and social issues of technology.

I believe my project would benefit from and contribute to the atmosphere of public, transparent and accessible.

Have the right skill to deliver.

----

I admired your well-known technical mentorship. hands-on approach. And also CMU won my respect by public good it generated - its mooc.

And I bring a detailed roadmap, if I have the honor to be accepted. To deliver my VCS, I would dual in primary IMA and secondary HCI. First, CS 245, 346 could give me a solid understanding on cutting-edge data management. Besides, according to my prior experience on database, I would like to waive CS 145 to take CS 395: Independent Database Project as an additional course, and make my VCS as a capstone project on CS 395. In HCI secondary, I would take ARTSTUDI179 Digital Art I from area (g). Also, I consider CS 240 and 249 in IMA to sharpen my low-level programming skill.

I am an indie hacker, but I'm not Athena who was born full-grown - I started programming at the age of 18. The only thing I'm sure of is that I would be somebody, early or late, in the software industry. And I applied for your renowned MSCS project to grow faster. I believe I will be a valuable asset to the project.
