Part 2: Purpose, Goals, and Achievements

...

Those are all valuable experience that can contribute to my goal of building an open-source version control system for artists.

## Main

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belief since my first exposure to programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers on the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people work together, a healthy relationship. In the age of remote work, it's time to apply insights from free/open-source software to other non-CS areas. I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. Compared with all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, like shared storage workspace, open-source VCS would lead to a free and unified ecosystem. Artist communities could enjoy the merit of asynchronous and fine-grained cooperation, which are well tested. Besides, a company-neutral open-source project can be compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creators, not just for specific drawing software producers.

As Walter Benjamin said, tech could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes. With an accessible VCS, enthusiasts could study exactly how professionals work. Remote artists can work together, just like Michelangelo and his apprentices working on the same mural. What's more, VCS would go further beyond yet another productivity tool, even beyond an art academy without walls. "Given enough eyeballs, all innovations will come out," by unleashing the power of social collaboration, a healthy community could make unprecedented large-scale projects. This idea first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If there were a VCS, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a second life.

All those sound like yet another crazy idea, but I am used to taking up challenges and pushed myself to sink-or-swim. I bootstrap myself in programming, by taking two honors program courses, Data Structure and Operating System, while dealing with hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics. To won my PingCAP intern, I took up their assignment with Golang, which I was not familiar then, kept hacking in the convenience store under dormitory for a week, and submitted the assignment ahead of time. What's more, I do not program for prestige and stability, because nobody chooses physics for those either. I program with love, and I want to do great at the risk of failing noisily.

I believe CMU's "hands-on" teaching approach can build up the skill I needed to lead a project: maturity in engineering, deep understanding in technical, economic and social issues. And CMU also win my respect by the mass public goods it created: I enjoyed Andy Pavlo's Advanced Database Systems during the pandemic, the quality and accessibility really impressed me. Also, the OSSTA report (Open Source Software Toolkits for the Arts) by the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO was one of the most valuable documentation I read about art and technology.

And I bring my roadmap, if I have the honor to be accepted. Your software practicum is the perfect place to transform my idea into real life product. Before that, I would engage in anti-disciplinary collaboration in Frank-Ratchye Studio early. Also, with a solid skill set to deliver in 17-\* courses, I would find my team member by working hand-in-hand with my fellows.  I would select [] as my elective course, to [].

I am an indie hacker, but I'm not Athena who was born full-grown - I started programming at the age of 18. The only thing I'm sure of is that I would be somebody, early or late, in the software industry. And I applied for your renowned MSE project to grow faster. I believe I will be a valuable asset to the project.
