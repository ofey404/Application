Statement of Purpose
====================

## Main

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belif since my first exposure of programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers in the web. As a self-driven programmer and open-source lover, I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. I believe the potential in digital illustration art creation can be unleashed if the right tool is there. And now is the right time to build it.

Digital illustrations could be distributed like open-source code, but now they act just like printed papers. In a sketching lesson, I found observing experienced classmates is a natural way to learn. I try to find someting like artist's *Github, but even in illustration sharing sites like *pixiv*, artworks are shared in the final output figure file format. Digital illustrations could have the merits of open-source collaboration, if the right tool is handed to artists - a open-source illustration version control system.

VCS would change how digital illustrations are enjoyed and createed. Most obviously, through commit histories, enthusiasts could learn how professional artists work, how certain effects are made, and how a design is refined. Besides, with VCS, remote artists can work together more smoothly through the Internet. In the time of Michelangelo, it was common for artists and apprentices to work on the same mural. And VCS would make this kind of collaboration possible again in nowaday's remote-working world.

What's more, VCS means more than yet another productivity tool; it can lay the foundation for new community of artists. With proper licenses, people can come together to contribute storyboards, figures, or other improvements to large scale projects. It would be especially beneficial for fan-art communities. Last but not least, VCS can give many unfinished works a second life. This idea of VCS first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If the fan-fiction community could come together, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a better ending.

For two reasons, I believe that a VCS for artists are feasible, and I can make it. First of all, coding is about managing cascading concepts and expressing them in the right and clear way. It's a common pattern in creative works, so version control could be a general way to manage materials. Also, I have the experience of introducing version control to the computational physics lab I worked two years ago. and it turned out to be a real productivity tool. I set up a private Gitlab instance, gave lectures and wrote documentation for my colleagues. Some of them used it to manage code, some stored slides, notes or drafts of papers. It is active used even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the invitation of their supervisor. Version control is a real treasure chest for creators. The workflow built around it has been well tested by the free/open-source community for years, and new way to use it would be actively developed by new type of creators.

I have suitable willpower and ability to carry this ambitious project out. On my road from a self-taught, interested driven programmer to a craftsman, I am used to take up challenges and make it through. As soon as I decided to take programming as a career rather than hobby, I put myself into a sink-or-swim situation. I took two honors program courses designed for sophomore or higher CS major students: Data Structure and Operating System. Dealing with hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics at the same time, I managed to survive and got a real kickstart. Furthermore, I form a passionate and agile hacking style in my PingCAP intern days. In interview, I was assigned to build a proxy with several error injection functionalities in one week. With few Golang experience then, I kept hacking in the convenience store under my dormitory, and finally I submitted the assignment on the sixth day. I won the job, found myself competent, and one of my project was widely deployed in the company's automated system test pipeline and maintained till now.

To make my dream come true, I won't work alone. My effort put into collaboration will help me on both teamworking and designing a successful VCS. As a TA of SOC lab, I realized the power of collaboration for the first time. Even after I left, newcomers said they knew me, by experiment videos I recorded. After I got my own projects, "More is different" is the very thing I understood in my path switch to engineering. The habit of organizing my work in a GitHub repository turned out to be a bonus in my recent research. When another graduated student came to this small team, I could always refer to lucrative pages - issues, pull requests, code review and technical dicisions. Besides, I believe the heart of free/open-source collaboration is healthy relationships between people. For about two years, I volunteered at PC Service Group, giving consultancy to my schoolmates on python. During my application, I published all my materials on a public Github repository, sharing them with anyone interested.

Stanford MSCS would be a perfect fit of my plan, for your pervasive computing strategy. VCS for illustrations is not only a contribute to discipline of illustration, but also a fundamantal program to the core of computer science. It's about reshaping the illustrator community. Moreover, your specialization also attracts me: HCI was my favourite, I can take lessons like Digital Art as sharpening my programming skill. Information Management and Analytics could also help me, since version control was about managing complicated low-level data. Your favorable consideration will be highly appreciated.

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I was a ... I want to build a open-source version control system for digital illustrations.

(short connecting paragraph) it's possible, and it's the time to build one.

- Eg: I am interested in art
- Many digital creator, sharing website
- but no social collaboration like Github

An open-source version control system would change the way we enjoy and create digital illustrations.

- learning
- collaboration, reshape the community
- give second life

Besides, I can do it because I have those qualities:

- Eg: My experience to introduce version control.
- Eg: Challange taker
- Eg: Focused on collaboration

Why I believe stanford is a good place to make my VCS:

(Short connecting paragraph) VCS for art would be a perfect fit of Stanford's pervasive computing strategy:

- contribute to other discipline
- to the core of computer science
- it's about society.

## SOP requirements

https://cs.stanford.edu/admissions/masters/application-checklist

Statement of Purpose - Your Statement of Purpose should be concise, focused, and well written. It should describe succinctly your reasons for applying to the proposed program at Stanford, your preparation for this field of study, research interests, future career plans, and other aspects of your background and interests which may aid the admissions committee in evaluating your aptitude and motivation for graduate study. The Statement of Purpose must be no more than two pages in length, single-spaced. It will be submitted as part of the online application.

FAQ: https://cs.stanford.edu/admissionz/faq#a1

> A: No, it is not required that a student have majored in CS but it is important that you have strong quantitative and analytical skills.

----

Strategic Plan: https://cs.stanford.edu/about/strategic-plan

> CS is become pervasive in all of society.

> Computational foundations for other academic disciplines: ... We recommend that successful hires should have the potential to make strong contributions to a non-CS discipline and to the core of computer science.


---- 

MS vs PhD:

> The MS program is excellent preparation for a career as a computer professional, or for future entry into a Ph.D. program at Stanford or elsewhere. Individual programs can be structured to consist entirely of coursework or to involve some research. For students more interested in research, an option for an "MS degree with distinction in research" has recently been added (see https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin1112/5254.htm)
