Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I was a ... I want to build a open-source version control system for digital illustrations.

An open-source version control system would change the way we enjoy and create digital illustrations.

- learning
- collaboration, reshape the community
- give second life

(short connecting paragraph) it's possible, and it's the time to build one.

- Many digital creator, sharing website
- but no social collaboration like Github

Besides, I can do it because I have those qualities:

- Eg: My experience to introduce version control.
- Eg: Challange taker
- Eg: Focused on collaboration

Why I believe stanford is a good place to make my VCS:

(Short connecting paragraph) VCS for art would be a perfect fit of Stanford's pervasive computing strategy:

- contribute to other discipline
- to the core of computer science
- it's about society.

---- 

MS vs PhD:

> The MS program is excellent preparation for a career as a computer professional, or for future entry into a Ph.D. program at Stanford or elsewhere. Individual programs can be structured to consist entirely of coursework or to involve some research. For students more interested in research, an option for an "MS degree with distinction in research" has recently been added (see https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin1112/5254.htm)
