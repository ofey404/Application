> The MS program is excellent preparation for a career as a computer professional, or for future entry into a Ph.D. program at Stanford or elsewhere. Individual programs can be structured to consist entirely of coursework or to involve some research. For students more interested in research, an option for an "MS degree with distinction in research" has recently been added (see https://web.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin1112/5254.htm)

## Diversity Statement

Stanford University regards the diversity of its graduate student body as an important factor in serving the educational mission of the university. We encourage you to share unique, personally important, and/or challenging factors in your background, such as work and life experiences, special interests, culture, socioeconomic status, the quality of your early educational environment, gender, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity. Please discuss how such factors would contribute to the diversity (broadly defined) of the entering class, and hence to the experience of your Stanford classmates.

Please provide an explanation of any gaps on your transcript indicating time away from your post-secondary institution(s) or program(s). Include name of institution.
