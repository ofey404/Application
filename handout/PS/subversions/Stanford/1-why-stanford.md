Statement of Purpose
====================

## Main

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belif since my first exposure of programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers in the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people working together, a healthy relationship. In the age of remote work, it's time to apply insights from free/open-source software to other non-CS area, so what I want to do is building an open-source version control system for digital illustrations.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. On current illustration sharing sites like *pixiv*, artworks are shared in the final output figure file format. Illustrators could have all merits programmers have enjoyed in open-source collaboration, if the right tool is put into their hands.

Among all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, open-source VCS would lead to a most free and unified ecosystem. Compared with online document or sharing project file directly, VCS enables asynchronous and fine-grained collaboration which can be foundation of a productive community willing to share. Besides, only company-neutral open-source project can make it compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creaters, not just for specific drawing software producer.

Tech could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes, as Walter Benjamin said. With an accessible VCS, enthusiasts could study exactly how professionals work, remote artists can work together like Michelangelo and his apprentices working on the same mural. What's more, VCS would go further beyond yet another productivity tool, even beyond an art academy without walls. "Given enough eyeballs, all innovations will come out", by unleashing the power of social collaboration, an healthy community could make unprecendented large scale projects. This idea first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If there were a VCS, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a better ending.

Shrink those parts:

- Why VCS beneficial?

Explain two **deadly attraction** of mine:

- Why Stanford MSCS?
- Why I chose to make VCS?

## Sketch

I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. 

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology. But mass social collaboration is yet to come. 

VCS would change how digital illustrations are created, lay foundation for new community, and gave unfinished work a second life.

In the age of remote work, open-source VCS is the best choice. It would lead to a free and unified ecosystem.

A VCS for artists are feasible, and I have prior experience on appling VCS in non-CS areas.

I am a challange taker, have willpower and ability to carry it out.
- Stanford's startup culture will help me on challanging and be the great.

I can collaboration and I really understand it.
- I need more soft skill to make my innovation come true.

Stanford's focus on pervasive computing strategy, and vast resources on social science and art would help me.

I am not Athena. I don't born full-grown. I was even a late starter. But I believe I would be somebody. I would be an indie hacker, finally an open-source leader or something like that. It's a loss if you don't take me into serious consideration.
