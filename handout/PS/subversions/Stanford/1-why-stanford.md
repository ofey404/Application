Statement of Purpose
====================

## Main

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belif since my first exposure of programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers in the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people working together, a healthy relationship. In the age of remote work, it's time to apply insights from free/open-source software to other non-CS area, so what I want to do is building an open-source version control system for digital illustrations.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. On current illustration sharing sites like *pixiv*, artworks are shared in the final output figure file format. Illustrators could have all merits programmers have enjoyed in open-source collaboration, if the right tool is put into their hands.

Among all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, open-source VCS would lead to a most free and unified ecosystem. Compared with online document or sharing project file directly, VCS enables asynchronous and fine-grained collaboration which can be foundation of a productive community willing to share. Besides, only company-neutral open-source project can make it compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creaters, not just for specific drawing software producer.

Tech could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes, as Walter Benjamin said. With an accessible VCS, enthusiasts could study exactly how professionals work, remote artists can work together, just like Michelangelo and his apprentices working on the same mural. What's more, VCS would go further beyond yet another productivity tool, even beyond an art academy without walls. "Given enough eyeballs, all innovations will come out", by unleashing the power of social collaboration, an healthy community could make unprecendented large scale projects. This idea first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If there were a VCS, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a second life.

Version control is a real treasure chest for all kinds of creators, and I started to understand this two years ago, when I set up a Gitlab for my colleagues in computational physics lab I worked then. After I gave several lectures and wrote documentations, some of them started to use it to manage code, some store slides, notes or even paper drafts. It is active used even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the invitation of their supervisor. In a word, coding is about managing cascading concepts, which is a common pattern in creative works. The workflow built around version control is well tested by decades of free/open-source collaboration, and creators would discover new way to utilize the power.

All those sounds like yet another crazy idea, but I am used to take up challanges and make it through. After decided to take programming seriously, I push myself to sink-or-swim. Two honors program courses, Data Structure and Operating System, designed for sophomore or higher CS major students, that's what I took, while dealing hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics. I managed to survive, got a real kickstart, and in addition, made lots of friends. My passionate and agile hacking style formed in my PingCAP intern days. The job interview task is to build a proxy with several error injection functionalities within one week. With few Golang experience then, I kept hacking in the convenience store under my dormitory, submitted the assignment on the sixth day. I won the job, and happliy found myself competent.  What's mroe, Nobody choose physics for prestige and stability, and I do not switch to programming for them either. I love programming, I want to be great in the risk of failing noisily, and Stanford is the place for my crazy ideas.

Shrink those parts:

- Why VCS beneficial?

Explain two **deadly attraction** of mine:

- Why Stanford MSCS?
- Why I chose to make VCS?

## Sketch

I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. 

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology. But mass social collaboration is yet to come. 

VCS would change how digital illustrations are created, lay foundation for new community, and gave unfinished work a second life.

In the age of remote work, open-source VCS is the best choice. It would lead to a free and unified ecosystem.

A VCS for artists are feasible, and I have prior experience on appling VCS in non-CS areas.

I am a challange taker, have willpower and ability to carry it out.
- Stanford's startup culture will help me on challanging and be the great.

I can collaboration and I really understand it.
- I need more soft skill to make my innovation come true.

Stanford's focus on pervasive computing strategy, and vast resources on social science and art would help me.

I am not Athena. I don't born full-grown. I was even a late starter. But I believe I would be somebody. I would be an indie hacker, finally an open-source leader or something like that. It's a loss if you don't take me into serious consideration.
