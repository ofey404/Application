Statement of Purpose
====================

## Main

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belief since my first exposure to programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers on the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people work together, a healthy relationship. In the age of remote work, it's time to apply insights from free/open-source software to other non-CS areas, so I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. I explored popular illustration sharing sites like *pixiv* while learning to sketch, but artworks are shared in the final output figure file format, rather than shared by source like Github. Illustrators could have all merits programmers have enjoyed in open-source collaboration if the right tool is put into their hands.

Among all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, open-source VCS would lead to a free and unified ecosystem. Compared with online documents or sharing project files directly, VCS enables asynchronous and fine-grained cooperation, which can be the foundation of a productive community willing to share. Besides, only a company-neutral open-source project can be compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creators, not just for specific drawing software producers.

As Walter Benjamin said, tech could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes. With an accessible VCS, enthusiasts could study exactly how professionals work. Remote artists can work together, just like Michelangelo and his apprentices working on the same mural. What's more, VCS would go further beyond yet another productivity tool, even beyond an art academy without walls. "Given enough eyeballs, all innovations will come out," by unleashing the power of social collaboration, a healthy community could make unprecedented large-scale projects. This idea first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If there were a VCS, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a second life.

Version control is a real treasure chest for all kinds of creators, and I started to understand this two years ago, when I set up a Gitlab instance for my colleagues in the computational physics lab I worked then. After I gave several lectures and wrote documentation, some started to manage code, some stored slides, notes, or even paper drafts. It is actively used even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the invitation of their supervisor. In a word, coding is about managing cascading concepts, which is a common pattern in creative works. The workflow built around version control is well tested by decades of free/open-source collaboration, and creators would discover new ways to utilize the power.

All those sound like yet another crazy idea, but I am used to taking up challenges and making it through. After I decided to take programming seriously, I pushed myself to sink-or-swim. Two honors program courses, Data Structure and Operating System, designed for sophomore or higher CS major students, that's what I took, while dealing with hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics. I managed to survive, got a real kickstart, and in addition, made lots of friends. My passionate and agile hacking style was formed in my PingCAP intern days. The job interview task is to build a proxy with several error injection functionalities, within one week. With few Golang experience then, I kept hacking in the convenience store under my dormitory, submitted the assignment on the sixth day. I won the job, and happily found myself competent. What's more, I do not program for prestige and stability, because nobody chooses physics for those either. I love programming, I want to be great at the risk of failing noisily, and I know that Stanford is the place for challengers with crazy ideas.

I won't work alone. I have rich collaboration experiences, and my understanding would help me design a successful VCS. Collaboration is even more powerful when it happens asynchronously and automatically. Newcomers of the SOC lab said they knew me, because they watched my experiment videos. In my recent research, the habit of organizing work with GitHub turned out to be a bonus, because there are always so many lucrative pages I can refer to - issues, pull requests, code review, and technical decisions. Besides, all free/open-source lovers know public good doesn't come from the void, and I'm willing to generate some. I volunteered at PC Service Group for about two years as a python consultant. And I published all my application materials on a public Github repository, to anyone interested. In a school so-called "a tech incubator with a football team," I can work with the best and the brightest, as well as sharpen the soft skills I urgently need - business knowledge, industry insights, and so on.

Stanford's focus on pervasive computing strategy, and vast resources on social science and art are attractive to me. VCS for illustrations is not only a contribute to discipline of illustration, but also a fundamantal program to the core of computer science. It's about reshaping the illustrator community. Moreover, your specialization also attracts me: HCI was my favorite, I can take lessons like Digital Art while sharpening my programming skill. Information Management and Analytics could also help me, since version control was about managing complex low-level data. (TODO: refactor)

I am an indie hacker, but I'm not Athena who was born full-grown - I started programming at the age of 18. The only thing I'm sure of is that I would be somebody, early or late, in the software industry. And I applied for your renowned MSCS project to grow faster. I believe I will be a valuable asset to the project.

Shrink those parts:

- Why VCS beneficial?

Explain two **deadly attraction** of mine:

- Why Stanford MSCS?
- Why I chose to make VCS?

## Sketch

I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. 

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology. But mass social collaboration is yet to come. 

VCS would change how digital illustrations are created, lay foundation for new community, and gave unfinished work a second life.

In the age of remote work, open-source VCS is the best choice. It would lead to a free and unified ecosystem.

A VCS for artists are feasible, and I have prior experience on appling VCS in non-CS areas.

I am a challange taker, have willpower and ability to carry it out.
- Stanford's startup culture will help me on challanging and be the great.

I can collaboration and I really understand it.
- I need more soft skill to make my innovation come true.

Stanford's focus on pervasive computing strategy, and vast resources on social science and art would help me.

I am not Athena. I don't born full-grown. I was even a late starter. But I believe I would be somebody, early or late. I would be an indie hacker, finally an open-source leader or something like that. It's a loss if you don't take me into serious consideration.
