### Statement of Purpose

- What is your purpose

My short-term goal is to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. In the long run, my goal is to be an open-source leader, focusing on disseminating knowledge. Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belief since my first exposure to programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers on the web. And in the age of remote work, it's time to apply free/open-source software insights to other non-CS areas. 

- Past experiences

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. I explored popular illustration sharing sites like *pixiv* while learning to sketch, but artworks are shared in the final output figure file format, rather than shared by source like *GitHub*. Illustrators could have all merits programmers have enjoyed in open-source collaboration if the right tool is put into their hands.

Among all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, open-source VCS would lead to a free and unified ecosystem. Compared with online documents or sharing project files directly, VCS enables asynchronous and fine-grained cooperation, which can be the foundation of a productive community willing to share. Besides, only a company-neutral open-source project can be compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creators, not just for specific drawing software producers.

Version control is a real treasure chest for all kinds of creators, and I started to understand this two years ago, when I set up a *Gitlab* instance for my colleagues in the computational physics lab I worked then. After I gave several lectures and wrote documentation, some started to manage code, some stored slides, notes, or even paper drafts. It is actively used even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the invitation of their supervisor. In a word, coding is about managing cascading concepts, which is a common pattern in creative works. The workflow built around version control is well tested by decades of free/open-source collaboration, and creators would discover new ways to utilize the power.

- Why CS

Besides, by introducing version control to the computational physics lab two years ago, I found version control a real treasure chest even for non-CS creators. At first, I set a *Gitlab* instance for myself, but after I gave several lectures and wrote documentation, my colleague started to utilize it in various ways: managing code, sharing slides, or even writing a paper together. It's actively used even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the supervisor's invitation. This experience made me feel it's possible to unleash the power for the artist community through an open-source version control system for illustrations, which will be discussed detailed in part 2.

All those sound like yet another crazy idea, but I am used to taking up challenges and pushing myself to sink-or-swim. I bootstrap myself in programming, by taking two honours program courses, Data Structure and Operating System, while dealing with hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics. To win my PingCAP intern, I took up their assignment with Golang, which I was unfamiliar with then, kept hacking in the convenience store under the dormitory for a week, and submitted the assignment ahead of time. What's more, I do not program for prestige and stability, because nobody chooses physics for those either. I program with love, and I want to do great at the risk of failing noisily.

- Why Program.
  - IDM lab and CV lab
  - Breads requirement, capstone

> This gives you an advantage over other engineers who know little about computer architecture, networking, and systems when you pivot to become a specialized engineer
> 
> Your first year will be tough.
> 
> Classes are very theoretical. 

I bring my roadmap, if I have the honor to be accepted. Being interested in Frank-Ratchye Studio, I would try to engage in its cross-disciplinary collaboration early. Besides, the software practicum is the perfect environment to transform my VCS into real-life product.

- Potential faculty mentors.

- Plans for your career.

In the long run, an open-source leader needs more than devotion, but maturity in engineering and a deep understanding of technical, economic, and social issues. I belive MSE-SS's focus on best practice and hands-on mentorship would give me a solid skillset. Besides, as community is just as important as code for open-source projects, courses like communication would fit my arsenal.

### Personal Statement

- Shaped your journey

Linux

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belief since my first exposure to programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers on the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people work together, a healthy relationship.

- Challange and motivation in education

All those sound like yet another crazy idea, but I am used to taking up challenges and pushing myself to sink-or-swim. I bootstrap myself in programming, by taking two honours program courses, Data Structure and Operating System, while dealing with hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics. To win my PingCAP intern, I took up their assignment with Golang, which I was unfamiliar with then, kept hacking in the convenience store under the dormitory for a week, and submitted the assignment ahead of time. What's more, I do not program for prestige and stability, because nobody chooses physics for those either. I program with love, and I want to do great at the risk of failing noisily.

- Diversity and equal opportunity.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. I explored popular illustration sharing sites like *pixiv* while learning to sketch, but artworks are shared in the final output figure file format, rather than shared by source like *GitHub*. Illustrators could have all merits programmers have enjoyed in open-source collaboration if the right tool is put into their hands.

Among all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, open-source VCS would lead to a free and unified ecosystem. Compared with online documents or sharing project files directly, VCS enables asynchronous and fine-grained cooperation, which can be the foundation of a productive community willing to share. Besides, only a company-neutral open-source project can be compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creators, not just for specific drawing software producers.

- How to contribute to diversity?

"Information is power," Aaron Swartz said, and that's what I understand directly and personally. The first thing I hacked was "One Piece". I finished all episodes on a Hong Kong channel in 2006, after government banned imported anime from prime time. Aiqing park is an abandoned park I played in as a kid. I wondered why it lay waste until I found that the poet's son was China's most controversial artist.

I won't be another brick in the wall, a self-serving elite, because I know how information is poisoned and people are divided. My VCS project is focused on disseminating knowledge, and I believe I can motivate my classmates to be more informed citizens.
