Statement of Purpose
=====================

## Main

In your project, my goal is to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. "More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switch from natural science to engineering. collaboration matters, and Great project goes beyond clever code. And in the age of remote work, it's time to apply free/open-source software insights to other non-CS areas.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. Compared with all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, like shared storage workspace, open-source VCS would lead to a free and unified ecosystem. Artist communities could enjoy the merit of asynchronous and fine-grained cooperation, which are well tested. Besides, a company-neutral open-source project can be compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creators, not just for specific drawing software producers.

As Walter Benjamin said, tech could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes. With an accessible VCS, enthusiasts could study exactly how professionals work. Remote artists can work together, just like Michelangelo and his apprentices working on the same mural. What's more, VCS would go further beyond yet another productivity tool, even beyond an art academy without walls. "Given enough eyeballs, all innovations will come out," by unleashing the power of social collaboration, a healthy community could make unprecedented large-scale projects. This idea first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If there were a VCS, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a second life.

Version control is a real treasure chest for all kinds of creators, and I started to understand this two years ago, when I set up a *Gitlab* instance for my colleagues in the computational physics lab I worked then. After I gave several lectures and wrote documentation, some started to manage code, some stored slides, notes, or even paper drafts. It is actively used even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the invitation of their supervisor. In a word, coding is about managing cascading concepts, which is a common pattern in creative works. The workflow built around version control is well tested by decades of free/open-source collaboration, and creators would discover new ways to utilize the power.

In the long run, an open-source leader is what I want to be. This path needs more than just devotion, but also maturity in engineering and a holistic understanding of technical, economic, and social issues. I believe UCLA could be a portal to larger context. Your theoretical orientation could give me a big picture of the CS descipline, and in your CS 201 seminars I can connect to widest possible array of great minds.

I bring my roadmap, if I have the honor to be accepted. The first year will be tough, but I would keep an eye on my Advanced to Candidacy (ATC). Planning to submit it early, I want to make my VCS as a Capstone Project. IDM lab and CV lab would be the perfect place for me to seek adversory and technical support.
