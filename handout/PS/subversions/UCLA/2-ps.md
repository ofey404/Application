Personal Statement
==================
## Main

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belief since my first exposure to programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers on the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people work together, a healthy relationship. Openness can be a unique power to shape the world, and my journey is guided by it.

I have rich collaboration experiences, and my understanding on it would help me design a successful VCS. Collaboration is even more powerful when it happens asynchronously and automatically. My experiment video recorded in SOC lab helped many newcomers, far beyond my expectations. In my recent research, the habit of organizing work with *GitHub* turned out to be a bonus, because there are always so many lucrative pages I can refer to - issues, pull requests, code review, and technical decisions. Besides, all free/open-source lovers know public good doesn't come from the void, and I'm willing to generate some. I volunteered at PC Service Group for about two years as a python consultant. And I published all my application materials on a public *GitHub* repository, to anyone interested.

The best part of today's Computer Science is its accessibility, an open bazaar for almost anyone willing to step in. And I am used to taking up challenges from it, pushing myself to sink-or-swim. I bootstrap myself in programming, by taking two honours program courses, Data Structure and Operating System, while dealing with hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics. To win my PingCAP intern, I took up their assignment with Golang, which I was unfamiliar with then, kept hacking in the convenience store under the dormitory for a week, and submitted the assignment ahead of time. What's more, I do not program for prestige and stability, because nobody chooses physics for those either. I program with love, and I want to do great at the risk of failing noisily. Building a VCS for visual artist sound like an ambitious task, but I am prepared to step on the gas.

"Information is power," Aaron Swartz said, and I would contribute to diversity by focusing on accessibility of my VCS. The mode of Git, distributed open-source version control, is proved to be effective in passing invisible wall. My common ID 'ofey404' is to remind the big day I bypassed the Great Firewall with open-source software. I won't be another brick in the wall, a self-serving elite, because I know how information is poisoned and people are divided. My VCS project is focused on disseminating knowledge, and I believe I can motivate my classmates to be more informed citizens.

I am an indie hacker, but I'm not Athena who was born full-grown - I started programming at the age of 18. The only thing I'm sure of is that I would be somebody, early or late, in the descipline of Computer Science. And I applied for your renowned MSCS project to grow faster. I believe I will be a valuable asset to the project.
