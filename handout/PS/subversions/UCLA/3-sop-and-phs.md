### Statement of Purpose

I want to build an open-source version control system for digital illustrations. "More is different." that's the very thing I understand after I switched from natural science to engineering, and experienced open-source social collaboration. Great project goes beyond clever individual. And in the age of remote work, it's time to apply free/open-source software insights to other non-CS areas.

Digital illustration creation has adopted CS as a core methodology, but mass social collaboration is yet to come. As a fan of visual art and manga, it's a pity. Compared with all possible solutions of visual artists' remote collaboration, like shared storage workspace, open-source VCS would lead to a free and unified ecosystem, in which artist communities could enjoy the merit of asynchronous and fine-grained cooperation. Besides, a company-neutral open-source project can be compatible with all competing file formats. It's for the good of all creators, not just for specific drawing software producers.

As Walter Benjamin said, tech could capture a place of its own among the artistic processes. With an accessible VCS, enthusiasts could study exactly how professionals work. Remote artists can work together, just like Michelangelo and his apprentices working on the same mural. What's more, VCS would go further beyond yet another productivity tool, even beyond an art academy without walls. "Given enough eyeballs, all innovations will come out," by unleashing the power of social collaboration, a healthy community could make unprecedented large-scale projects. This idea first hit me when I was shocked by the early death of Miura Kentaro, author of the famous manga *Berserk*. If there were a VCS, more posthumous or unfinished works would have a second life.

Version control is a real treasure chest for all kinds of creators, and I started to understand this two years ago, when I set up a *Gitlab* instance for my colleagues in the computational physics lab I worked then. After I gave several lectures and wrote documentation, some started to manage code, some stored slides, notes, or even paper drafts. It is actively used even after I left, and last month I gave a lecture about git to their newcomers at the invitation of their supervisor. Coding is about managing cascading concepts, which is a common pattern in creative works. And creators would discover new ways to utilize the power.

In the long run, an open-source leader is what I want to be. This path needs more than just devotion, but also maturity in engineering and a holistic understanding of technical, economic, and social issues. I believe UCLA could be my portal to larger context. Your theoretical orientation could give me a big picture of the CS descipline, and in your CS 201 seminars I can connect to widest possible array of great minds.

I bring my roadmap, if I have the honor to be accepted. The first year will be tough, but I would keep an eye on my Advanced to Candidacy (ATC). Planning to submit it early, I want to make my VCS as a Capstone Project. IDM lab and CV lab would be the perfect place for me to seek adversory and technical support.

### Personal Statement

Technology should help people develop themselves and connect together. I hold this belief since my first exposure to programming - installing Linux with the help of friendly strangers on the web. In my opinion, the heart of free/open-source collaboration is the way people work together, a healthy relationship. Openness can be a unique power to shape the world, and my journey is guided by it.

I have rich collaboration experiences, and my understanding on it would help me design a successful VCS. Collaboration is even more powerful when it happens asynchronously and automatically. My experiment video recorded in SOC lab helped many newcomers, far beyond my expectations. In my recent research, the habit of organizing work with *GitHub* turned out to be a bonus, because there are always so many lucrative pages I can refer to - issues, pull requests, code review, and technical decisions. Besides, all free/open-source lovers know public good doesn't come from the void, and I'm willing to generate some. I volunteered at PC Service Group for about two years as a python consultant. And I published all my application materials on a public *GitHub* repository, to anyone interested.

The best part of today's Computer Science is its accessibility, an open bazaar for almost anyone willing to step in. And I am used to taking up challenges from it, pushing myself to sink-or-swim. I bootstrap myself in programming, by taking two honours program courses, Data Structure and Operating System, while dealing with hardcore physics courses like Electrodynamics. To win my PingCAP intern, I took up their assignment with Golang, which I was unfamiliar with then, kept hacking in the convenience store under the dormitory for a week, and submitted the assignment ahead of time. What's more, I do not program for prestige and stability, because nobody chooses physics for those either. I program with love, and I want to do great at the risk of failing noisily. Building a VCS for visual artist sound like an ambitious task, but I am prepared to step on the gas.

"Information is power," Aaron Swartz said, and I would contribute to diversity by focusing on accessibility. The mode of Git, distributed open-source version control, is proved to be effective in passing invisible wall. My common ID 'ofey404' is to remind the big day I bypassed the Great Firewall with open-source software. I won't be another brick in the wall, a self-serving elite, because I know how information is poisoned and people are divided. My VCS project is focused on disseminating knowledge, and I believe I can motivate my classmates to be more informed citizens.

I am an indie hacker, but I'm not Athena who was born full-grown - I started programming at the age of 18. The only thing I'm sure of is that I would be somebody, early or late, in the descipline of Computer Science. And I applied for your renowned MSCS project to grow faster. I believe I will be a valuable asset to the project.
