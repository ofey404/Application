## Generalist is valuable

> Programmer geeks can't lead, and leaders can't hack.
> It's rare to find someone who's even decent at both.

Insight from my physics background:

- Relly understand what you are doing.

## Case: A delayed throughput recorder

~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[ Client ] - high performance -> [ Server \| @Recorder ]

## Case: I wish I had known more about software engineering

> ... we're looking for something that gets us from a requirement

**Systematic** approaches to make a project succeed

## Curriculum

> ... our graduates are perfectly suited to do what few others
> can: DELIVER.  -- *CMU MSE Website*

## Technical mentorship and fellowship

> Craftsmanship is a contagion, a kind of mental virus.
> You catch it by observing others and allowing the meme to take hold.
> -- *The Clean Coder*

- Working hand-in-hand with classmates and faculties
