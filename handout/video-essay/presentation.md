# No.1 Weakness To Overcome

**Planning, budgeting, staffing and risk management**

> Programmer geeks can't lead, and leaders can't hack.
> It's rare to find someone who's even decent at both.

Insight from my physics background:

- Relly understand what you are doing.
    - In physics, there is no "programming by conicidence".
- I want to be **great**.
    - Nobody study physics just for a stable and comfortable life.

## Case: A delayed throughput recorder

~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[ Client ] - high performance -> [ Server \| @Recorder ]

Requirements were vague, environment was changing.

I relied on unit performance test rather than in real environment.

In stress testing, my recorder became a bottleneck.

I should make rubber hits the road earlier.

There are **systematic** approaches to make a project succeeded:
- Planning, budgeting, staffing and risk management.

Craftsmanship is a meme. I'll catch it by observing others.
