## No.1 Weakness To Overcome

Hi, I'm Weiwen Chen. The weakness I want to overcome most in your program is a holistic set of soft skills to deliver software projects.
 
To be specific, it's formal software development methodology, including task management and communication skills.

They are critical to building my planned project, open-source VCS and becoming an open-source leader.

## It's valuable to be a generalist

Sometimes it's not a question of getting the opportunities, but a question of *knowing* that opportunities are there.

It's invaluable if a geek can lead, or a leader can hack, simply **knowing** possible solution can provide flexibility.

Besides, knowledge of formal methodology can improve the feeling of ownership at work.

Because if you want to own a process, help implement it.

## Don't worry, I'll be a geek!

Above all, I think I'll have good technical abilities.

My background in physics gives me two insights:

First, I would really understand what I'm doing. In physics, there is no such thing like "Programming by coincidence". First principle matters.

Besides, I want to be great. Because nobody do physics for a stable and comfortable life. I switch to programming because I love it, and I want to be a great engineer.

## Case: A delayed throughput recorder

But I know that I miss some critical skills in formal methodology.

I've ever made a project delayed, it's a throughput recorder.

The requirements were vague, the environment was changing, and I was not familiar with the codebase.

So I relied on unit performance tests rather than test in real environment.

It worked well in unit test, but in real environment, my recorder became a bottleneck.

## Case: I wish I had known "Tracer Bullets" earlier.

Several monthes later, I read the book the Pragmatic Programmer, and I realized that the "Tracer Bullets" method is what I need previously.

I know that I should make rubber hits the road earlier, but I don't know exactly how to do it.

And now I understand that, to make a software project succeeded, there are systematic approaches.

## Curriculum

And I believe that your program would help me overcome it.

First, In your plan of study, there are courses like Agile Methods, Software Project Management.

Planning, budgeting, staffing and risk management, they are a set of skills that can be teached and trained. And I'll get them.

## Technical mentorship and fellowship

Besides, in CMU I can work hand-in-hand with my classmates, and faculty are more like mentors, not teachers.

Craftsmanship is the mindset held by professionals, it can be learnt by observing and doing.

It's just like a meme, by working with the best and the brightest, I'll catch the meme, and contribute to the program at the same time.

## Thank you for watching!

Thank you for watching.

And here are some additional information about me:

Let's have some music.

## Sketch 

Additional information: I am studying drawing and I can play bass.

Sometimes I would wonder if it's the only chance in my life.

Leader is to notice that something is there

3. Tell us about the area of weakness you most hope your studies at CMU would help you to overcome.

What my study can help me to overcome?

Own the process by help implement it.
