Engineering.

Sometimes I program by coincidence. (Passionate p20)

Strategy for planning and creating a successful career.

I don't quite afraid of mastering technical skills.

My physics background give me two key insights:
- Nobody do physics by conicidence. You should really understand what you are doing.
- Nobody become a physicist because they want get a job and lead a comfortable job. They want to be **great**.

How to invest myself effectively.

I want to be the worst and the best.

The people around you can affect your own performance.

## Tracer bullet

I wish I know idea of "Tracer Bullets" early. Facing a large number of unknowns. If I code under same environment and under same constraints as real application.


In my recent work in lab, my first task was building a throughput recorder in the server side.

~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[ A ] - to -> [ B ]
~~~

I am working with codebase I was not familiar with, trying to hit a target in the dark. Requirements are vague. Environment are changing.

I made a mistake: Didn't test my recorder in real environment, instead I rely on unit test to check the performance.

We need to stress test, use 100% of server's CPU.

At that time the performance of recorder turned out to be a bottleneck.

Project is delayed.

After that, I read about "Tracer Bullet" in the Pragmatic Programmer

- To avoid specify the system to death, achieve an end-to-end connection among the components of your system early.
- under same environment and under same constraints as real application.
- Check how close to the target you are, adjusting if necessary.

That's what I need, but I don't know previously.

Make rubber meets the road early.

I want a holistice skillset to deliver.

Programmer geeks can’t lead, and leaders can’t hack.
