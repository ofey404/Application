## No.1 Weakness To Overcome

Hi, I'm Weiwen Chen. The weakness I want to overcome most in your program is the ability of planning, budgeting, staffing and risk management.

It's invaluable if a geek can lead, or a leader can hack. That's what I exactly want, a holistic set of soft skills to deliver software projects successfully.

## Don't worry, I'll be a geek!

Above all, I believe I'll have good technical abilities.

My background of physics gives me two insights:

First, I would really understand what I'm doing. In physics, there is no such thing like "Programming by coincidence". First principle matters.

Besides, I want to be great. Because nobody study physics just for a stable and comfortable life. I switch to programming because I love it, and I want to be a great engineer.


## Case: A delayed throughput recorder

But I know that I miss some critical skills in project management.

I've ever made a project delayed. It was building a throughput recorder between a pair of high-performance server-client.

The requirements were vague, the environment was changing, and I was not familiar with the code base.

So I relied on unit performance test rather than test in real environment.

It worked well in unit test, but in stress testing, my recorder became a bottleneck. So I did a painfully rewrite.

## Case: I wish I know "Tracer Bullets" earlier.

Several monthes later, I read the book the Pragmatic Programmer, and I realized that the "Tracer Bullets" method is what I need previously.

I know that I should make rubber hits the road earlier, but I don't know exactly how to do it.

And now I understand that There are systematic approaches to make a software project succeeded.

Planning, budgeting, staffing and risk management, delivery a project a set of skills that can be trained.

## ...And I believe that my study would overcome it.

And I believe that your project would help me overcome it.

There are courses like Agile Methods, Software Project Management, they are what I want.

What's more, it' attractive for me to work with the best and the brightest in your project.

I believe that craftsmanship is a meme, and I'll catch it by observing and working with others.

## Thank you for watching!

Thank you for watching.

And here are some addition information about me:

Let's have some music.
