20 Failure Experiences
======================


## 1

My response to pressure is hiding myself.

When I feel nervous about tasks assigned in BeBeyond, I just can't persuade myself start doing them.

Sometimes I lied to myself that another thing (like coding for my lab) is more "meaningful", sometimes I lie on my bed, feeling exausted. And this often make the situation worse.



## 2

I leave too many undone plans, task and TODO behind me.

Playing music, dig more in a certain technical field(like fuzzing)...and so on.

Maybe I'm too ambitious and get discouraged too soon, maybe I just don't have the strong will to push something continously.


## 3

I engaged in an open source promotion program this summer, but my tutor didn't pick me.

So I didn't continue on that project.

I shouldn't apply that program. They need experienced developer about that project, not a novice like me.


## 4

I take sketch lesson this semester. At the first class, a girl is willing to help me, recommended some sketch books to me. But three classes later, when our teacher told us to "look at others' drawing", she says: "go back and draw yours, don't look at mine".

Maybe she thinks my progress is too slow, or I don't take her advice seriously, so don't want talk to me anymore.

But I do bought books and tools, practise in my spare time. I never learnt drawing before, I don't have too much time to spend, and in my eyes my sketch looks much better than three weeks ago.


## 5

I really can't get into the mood of writing myself. I can feel a strong pulse of rejection but I don't know why.

I don't want to talk about myself, in 50/20. I don't talk about my family, my love experience or my real politic views, I avoid talking about personal things. I just talk about computer. Talking about computer make me feel safe, though it makes me dull.

I realize that when I finish half of my 50/20. In my deep mind, maybe I'm still a kid lacking sense of security. I hide myself subcounsciously.


## 6

Actually I'm sad that nobody is interested in my experience here. Here are shiny people, and I feel like a loser.

I told myself life is equal. I don't pay attention to others much before, so I deserved it. Since I don't take real effort to understand others, learn from them and help them, my view about myself can only dangling between arrogant and self-abased.

TODO: Read another 50+20, and reply, today.
